## Overview

When interacting with either Qi or Quai, it is necessary to use a private key authenticate actions by signing a payload.

**Wallets are the simplest way** to expose the concept of an Externally Owner Account (EOA) or UTXO account as it wraps a private key and supports high-level methods to sign common types of interaction and send transactions.

The class most developers will want to use is [Wallet](/sdk/content/classes/Wallet), **which can load a private key directly or from any common wallet format**.

The SDK also supports Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets for both Quai and Qi ledgers. Developers who need access to low-level wallet details can opt to use the [QuaiHDWallet](/sdk/content/classes/QuaiHDWallet) and [QiHDWallet](/sdk/content/classes/QiHDWallet) classes.

## Usage

Developers working on the account model Quai ledger have two options for wallet configurations:

- **Base Wallet**: The simplest implementation of a Quai Wallet
- **Quai HD Wallet**: A Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet for the Quai ledger

Developers working on the UTXO model Qi ledger currently have a single option for wallet configuration:

- **Qi HD Wallet**: A Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet for the Qi ledger

### Quai Wallets

Quai wallets can be initialized using either the [Wallet](/sdk/content/classes/Wallet) class or the [QuaiHDWallet](/sdk/content/classes/QuaiHDWallet) class.

The simplest wallet configuration is using the **Wallet** class. All that is needed to initiate a wallet is a private key and a provider. Once configured, the wallet acts similar to a [Signer](/sdk/content/classes/Signer). 

```js
import { Wallet } from 'quais'

// initialize wallet from private key
const wallet = new Wallet(privateKey, provider)
```

The [QuaiHDWallet](/sdk/content/classes/QuaiHDWallet) class provides additional low-level functionality on top of the base [Wallet](/sdk/content/classes/Wallet) class, allowing for more granular control.

```js
import { QuaiHDWallet, Zone } from 'quais'

// initialize HD wallet
const QuaiWallet = new QuaiHDWallet()

// get the first address in Paxos2 zone
const paxos2Address = QuaiWallet.getNextAddress(0, Zone.Paxos2)

// serialize current (account/address) state of the wallet
const serializedWallet = QuaiWallet.serialize() 
```

### Qi Wallets

Qi wallets **can only be initialized** using the [QiHDWallet](/sdk/content/classes/QiHDWallet) class.

```js
import { QiHDWallet, Zone } from 'quais'

// initialize HD wallet
const QiWallet = new QiHDWallet()

// get the first address in Cyrpus1 zone
const cyrpus1Address = QiWallet.getNextAddress(0, Zone.Cyrpus1)

// serialize current (account/address) state of the wallet
const serializedWallet = QiWallet.serialize() 
```
