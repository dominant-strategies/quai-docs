## Overview

**A Provider establishes a connection to the blockchain**, whch can be used to query its current state, simulate execution and send transactions to update the state.

Providers are one of the most fundamental components of interacting with a blockchain application, and there are many ways to connect, such as _over HTTP_, _WebSockets_ or _injected providers such as Pelagus_.

## Usage

There are two types of network providers you can connect to:
- **Browser/Injected Providers**: typically wallet interfaces used in browser Applications
- **Remote Node Providers**: any remote node that is open to data requests


### Injected Provider

There are multiple ways to configure a network provider using the [Provider](/sdk/content/interfaces/Provider) interface.

To connect to a browser wallet provider like Pelagus, use the [BrowserProvider](/sdk/content/classes/BrowserProvider) class. Pelagus bundles a Signer into the injected provider that can be used to sign transactions.

```js
import { quais } from 'quais'

// configure pelagus as the provider
const provider = new quais.BrowserProvider(window.pelagus)

// get the signer
const signer = provider.getSigner()
```

### Remote Node Provider

To connect to a remote node provider, use the [JsonRpcProvider](/sdk/content/classes/JsonRpcProvider) class. This connects to a remote node using the JSON-RPC interface. **Remote node providers will never have a signer bundled into them**.

Remote providers generally provide a connection to all chains within the network. Once a provider is configured, any data passed to it will be interpretted by the provider and routed to the correct chain automatically by the SDK.

```js
import { quais } from 'quais'

// configure a remote node provider
const provider = new quais.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.sandbox.quai.network')
```
