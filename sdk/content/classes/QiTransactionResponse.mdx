A **QiTransactionResponse** includes all properties about a Qi transaction that was sent to the network, which may or
may not be included in a block.

The TransactionResponse.isMined | **TransactionResponse.isMined** can be used to check if the transaction has
been mined as well as type guard that the otherwise possibly `null` properties are defined.

## Implements

- `QiTransactionLike`
- `QiTransactionResponseParams`

## Properties

| Property | Modifier | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `blockHash` | `readonly` | `null` \| `string` | The blockHash of the block that this transaction was included in.<br /><br />This is `null` for pending transactions. |
| `blockNumber` | `readonly` | `null` \| `number` | The block number of the block that this transaction was included in.<br /><br />This is `null` for pending transactions. |
| `chainId` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The chain ID. |
| `hash` | `readonly` | `string` | The transaction hash. |
| `index` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The index within the block that this transaction resides at. |
| `provider` | `readonly` | [`Provider`](/sdk/content/interfaces/Provider) | The provider this is connected to, which will influence how its methods will resolve its async inspection<br />methods. |
| `signature` | `readonly` | `string` | The signature. |
| `type` | `readonly` | `number` | The [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transaction envelope type. This is `0` for legacy<br />transactions types. |

## Methods

### confirmations()

```ts
confirmations(): Promise<number>
```

Resolve to the number of confirmations this transaction has.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`number`\>

A promise resolving to the number of confirmations.

***

### getBlock()

```ts
getBlock(shard): Promise<null | Block>
```

Resolves to the Block that this transaction was included in.

This will return null if the transaction has not been included yet.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `shard` | [`Shard`](/sdk/content/enumerations/Shard) | The shard to fetch the block from. |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| [`Block`](/sdk/content/classes/Block)\>

A promise resolving to the block or null if not found.

#### Source

***

### getTransaction()

```ts
getTransaction(): Promise<null | QiTransactionResponse>
```

Resolves to this transaction being re-requested from the provider. This can be used if you have an unmined
transaction and wish to get an up-to-date populated instance.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| [`QiTransactionResponse`](/sdk/content/classes/QiTransactionResponse)\>

A promise resolving to the transaction, or null if not found.

#### Throws

If the transaction is not found.

***

### isMined()

```ts
isMined(): this is QiMinedTransactionResponse
```

Returns `true` if this transaction has been included.

This is effective only as of the time the TransactionResponse was instantiated. To get up-to-date information,
use [**getTransaction**](/sdk/content/classes/QiTransactionResponse#gettransaction).

This provides a Type Guard that this transaction will have non-null property values for properties that are null
for unmined transactions.

#### Returns

`this is QiMinedTransactionResponse`

True if the transaction has been mined or false otherwise.

***

### removedEvent()

```ts
removedEvent(): OrphanFilter
```

Returns a filter which can be used to listen for orphan events that evict this transaction.

#### Returns

[`OrphanFilter`](/sdk/content/type-aliases/OrphanFilter)

The orphan filter.

#### Source

[providers/provider.ts:2481](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quais.js/blob/fb5056470a1764523d26300fe8f88b8fb93d7f2c/src/providers/provider.ts#L2481)

***

### reorderedEvent()

```ts
reorderedEvent(other?): OrphanFilter
```

Returns a filter which can be used to listen for orphan events that re-order this event against `other`.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `other`? | [`TransactionResponse`](/sdk/content/type-aliases/TransactionResponse) | The other transaction to compare against. |

#### Returns

[`OrphanFilter`](/sdk/content/type-aliases/OrphanFilter)

The orphan filter.

***

### replaceableTransaction()

```ts
replaceableTransaction(startBlock): QiTransactionResponse
```

Returns a new TransactionResponse instance which has the ability to detect (and throw an error) if the
transaction is replaced, which will begin scanning at `startBlock`.

This should generally not be used by developers and is intended primarily for internal use. Setting an incorrect
`startBlock` can have devastating performance consequences if used incorrectly.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `startBlock` | `number` | The block number to start scanning for replacements. |

#### Returns

[`QiTransactionResponse`](/sdk/content/classes/QiTransactionResponse)

The replaceable transaction.

### toJSON()

```ts
toJSON(): any
```

Returns a JSON-compatible representation of this transaction.

#### Returns

`any`
