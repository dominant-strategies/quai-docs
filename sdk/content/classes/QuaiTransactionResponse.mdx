A **QuaiTransactionResponse** includes all properties about a Quai transaction that was sent to the network, which
may or may not be included in a block.

The TransactionResponse.isMined | **TransactionResponse.isMined** can be used to check if the transaction has
been mined as well as type guard that the otherwise possibly `null` properties are defined.

## Properties

| Property | Modifier | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `accessList` | `readonly` | `null` \| [`AccessList`](/sdk/content/type-aliases/AccessList) | The [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930) access list for transaction types that support it,<br />otherwise `null`. |
| `blockHash` | `readonly` | `null` \| `string` | The blockHash of the block that this transaction was included in.<br /><br />This is `null` for pending transactions. |
| `blockNumber` | `readonly` | `null` \| `number` | The block number of the block that this transaction was included in.<br /><br />This is `null` for pending transactions. |
| `chainId` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The chain ID. |
| `data` | `readonly` | `string` | The data. |
| `from` | `readonly` | `string` | The sender of this transaction. It is implicitly computed from the transaction pre-image hash (as the digest) and<br />the [**signature** ](/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse) using ecrecover. |
| `gasLimit` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The maximum units of gas this transaction can consume. If execution exceeds this, the entries transaction is<br />reverted and the sender is charged for the full amount, despite not state changes being made. |
| `gasPrice` | `readonly` | `null` \| `bigint` | The maximum fee (per unit of gas) to allow this transaction to charge the sender. |
| `hash` | `readonly` | `string` | The transaction hash. |
| `index` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The index within the block that this transaction resides at. |
| `nonce` | `readonly` | `number` | The nonce, which is used to prevent replay attacks and offer a method to ensure transactions from a given sender<br />are explicitly ordered.<br /><br />When sending a transaction, this must be equal to the number of transactions ever sent by<br />[**from** ](/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse). |
| `provider` | `readonly` | [`Provider`](/sdk/content/interfaces/Provider) | The provider this is connected to, which will influence how its methods will resolve its async inspection<br />methods. |
| `signature` | `readonly` | [`Signature`](/sdk/content/classes/Signature) | The signature. |
| `to` | `readonly` | `null` \| `string` | The receiver of this transaction.<br /><br />If `null`, then the transaction is an initcode transaction. This means the result of executing the<br />[**data** ](/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse) will be deployed as a new contract on chain (assuming it does not<br />revert) and the address may be computed using [getCreateAddress](../functions/getCreateAddress). |
| `type` | `readonly` | `number` | The [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transaction envelope type. This is `0` for legacy<br />transactions types. |
| `value` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The value, in wei. Use [formatEther](../functions/formatEther) to format this value as ether. |

## Methods

### confirmations()

```ts
confirmations(): Promise<number>
```

Resolve to the number of confirmations this transaction has.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`number`\>

A promise resolving to the number of confirmations.

#### Throws

If the block is not found.

#### Source

[providers/provider.ts:1931](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quais.js/blob/fb5056470a1764523d26300fe8f88b8fb93d7f2c/src/providers/provider.ts#L1931)

***

### getBlock()

```ts
getBlock(shard): Promise<null | Block>
```

Resolves to the Block that this transaction was included in.

This will return null if the transaction has not been included yet.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `shard` | [`Shard`](/sdk/content/enumerations/Shard) | The shard to fetch the block from. |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| [`Block`](/sdk/content/classes/Block)\>

A promise resolving to the block.

#### Source

[providers/provider.ts:1892](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quais.js/blob/fb5056470a1764523d26300fe8f88b8fb93d7f2c/src/providers/provider.ts#L1892)

***

### getTransaction()

```ts
getTransaction(): Promise<null | QuaiTransactionResponse>
```

Resolves to this transaction being re-requested from the provider. This can be used if you have an unmined
transaction and wish to get an up-to-date populated instance.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| [`QuaiTransactionResponse`](/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse)\>

A promise resolving to the transaction, or null if not found.

#### Source

[providers/provider.ts:1916](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quais.js/blob/fb5056470a1764523d26300fe8f88b8fb93d7f2c/src/providers/provider.ts#L1916)

***

### isMined()

```ts
isMined(): this is QuaiMinedTransactionResponse
```

Returns `true` if this transaction has been included.

This is effective only as of the time the TransactionResponse was instantiated. To get up-to-date information,
use [**getTransaction**](/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse#gettransaction).

This provides a Type Guard that this transaction will have non-null property values for properties that are null
for unmined transactions.

#### Returns

`this is QuaiMinedTransactionResponse`

True if the transaction has been mined.

#### Throws

If the transaction was replaced, repriced, or cancelled.

***

### removedEvent()

```ts
removedEvent(): OrphanFilter
```

Returns a filter which can be used to listen for orphan events that evict this transaction.

#### Returns

[`OrphanFilter`](/sdk/content/type-aliases/OrphanFilter)

The orphan filter.

#### Source

[providers/provider.ts:2198](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quais.js/blob/fb5056470a1764523d26300fe8f88b8fb93d7f2c/src/providers/provider.ts#L2198)

***

### reorderedEvent()

```ts
reorderedEvent(other?): OrphanFilter
```

Returns a filter which can be used to listen for orphan events that re-order this event against `other`.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `other`? | [`TransactionResponse`](/sdk/content/type-aliases/TransactionResponse) | The other transaction to compare against. |

#### Returns

[`OrphanFilter`](/sdk/content/type-aliases/OrphanFilter)

The orphan filter.

#### Source

***

### replaceableTransaction()

```ts
replaceableTransaction(startBlock): QuaiTransactionResponse
```

Returns a new TransactionResponse instance which has the ability to detect (and throw an error) if the
transaction is replaced, which will begin scanning at `startBlock`.

This should generally not be used by developers and is intended primarily for internal use. Setting an incorrect
`startBlock` can have devastating performance consequences if used incorrectly.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `startBlock` | `number` | The block number to start scanning for replacements. |

#### Returns

[`QuaiTransactionResponse`](/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse)

The replaceable transaction.

***

### toJSON()

```ts
toJSON(): any
```

Returns a JSON-compatible representation of this transaction.

#### Returns

`any`

#### Source

***

### wait()

```ts
wait(_confirms?, _timeout?): Promise<null | TransactionReceipt>
```

Resolves once this transaction has been mined and has `confirms` blocks including it (default: `1`) with an
optional `timeout`.

This can resolve to `null` only if `confirms` is `0` and the transaction has not been mined, otherwise this will
wait until enough confirmations have completed.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `_confirms`? | `number` | The number of confirmations to wait for. |
| `_timeout`? | `number` | The number of milliseconds to wait before rejecting. |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| [`TransactionReceipt`](/sdk/content/classes/TransactionReceipt)\>

A promise resolving to the transaction receipt.

#### Throws

If the transaction was replaced, repriced, or cancelled.
