An **EventLog** contains additional properties parsed from the [**Log**](/sdk/content/classes/Log).

## Extends

- [`Log`](/sdk/content/classes/Log)

## Properties

| Property | Modifier | Type | Description | Inherited from |
| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `address` | `readonly` | `string` | The address of the contract that emitted this log. | [`Log`](/sdk/content/classes/Log).`address` |
| `args` | `readonly` | [`Result`](/sdk/content/classes/Result) | The parsed arguments passed to the event by `emit`. | - |
| `blockHash` | `readonly` | `string` | The block hash of the block this log occurred in. Use the [**Log.getBlock**](/sdk/content/classes/Log#getblock) to get the<br />[**Block**](/sdk/content/classes/Block). | [`Log`](/sdk/content/classes/Log).`blockHash` |
| `blockNumber` | `readonly` | `number` | The block number of the block this log occurred in. It is preferred to use the Block.hash \| **Block.hash**<br />when fetching the related [**Block**](/sdk/content/classes/Block), since in the case of an orphaned block, the block at that<br />height may have changed. | [`Log`](/sdk/content/classes/Log).`blockNumber` |
| `data` | `readonly` | `string` | The data included in this log when it was emitted. | [`Log`](/sdk/content/classes/Log).`data` |
| `fragment` | `readonly` | [`EventFragment`](/sdk/content/classes/EventFragment) | The matching event. | - |
| `index` | `readonly` | `number` | The index within the block this log occurred at. This is generally not useful to developers, but can be used with<br />the various roots to proof inclusion within a block. | [`Log`](/sdk/content/classes/Log).`index` |
| `interface` | `readonly` | [`Interface`](/sdk/content/classes/Interface) | The Contract Interface. | - |
| `provider` | `readonly` | [`Provider`](/sdk/content/interfaces/Provider) | The provider connected to the log used to fetch additional details if necessary. | [`Log`](/sdk/content/classes/Log).`provider` |
| `removed` | `readonly` | `boolean` | If the **Log** represents a block that was removed due to an orphaned block, this will be true.<br /><br />This can only happen within an orphan event listener. | [`Log`](/sdk/content/classes/Log).`removed` |
| `topics` | `readonly` | readonly `string`[] | The indexed topics included in this log when it was emitted.<br /><br />All topics are included in the bloom filters, so they can be efficiently filtered using the<br />[**Provider.getLogs**](/sdk/content/interfaces/Provider#getlogs) method. | [`Log`](/sdk/content/classes/Log).`topics` |
| `transactionHash` | `readonly` | `string` | The transaction hash of the transaction this log occurred in. Use the<br />[**Log.getTransaction**](/sdk/content/classes/Log#gettransaction) to get the<br />[**TransactionResponse](/sdk/content/type-aliases/TransactionResponse). | [`Log`](/sdk/content/classes/Log).`transactionHash` |
| `transactionIndex` | `readonly` | `number` | The index within the transaction of this log. | [`Log`](/sdk/content/classes/Log).`transactionIndex` |
