```ts
type FixedFormat: number | string | {
  "decimals": number;
  "signed": boolean;
  "width": number;
};
```

Returns a new FixedFormat for `value`.

If `value` is specified as a `number`, the bit-width is 128 bits and `value` is used for the `decimals`.

A string `value` may begin with `fixed` or `ufixed` for signed and unsigned respectfully. If no other properties are
specified, the bit-width is 128-bits with 18 decimals.

To specify the bit-width and demicals, append them separated by an `"x"` to the `value`.

For example, `ufixed128x18` describes an unsigned, 128-bit wide format with 18 decimals.

If `value` is an other object, its properties for `signed`, `width` and `decimals` are checked.
