```ts
type FormatType: "sighash" | "minimal" | "full" | "json";
```

The format to serialize the output as.

**`sighash`** - the bare formatting, used to compute the selector or topic hash; this format cannot be reversed (as
it discards `indexed`) so cannot by used to export an [Interface](../classes/Interface).

**`minimal`** - Human-Readable ABI with minimal spacing and without names, so it is compact, but will result in
Result objects that cannot be accessed by name.

**`full`** - Full Human-Readable ABI, with readable spacing and names intact; this is generally the recommended
format.

**`json`** - The [ABI JSON Specification](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/abi-spec.html#json).
