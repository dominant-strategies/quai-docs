```ts
type Networkish: 
  | Network
  | number
  | bigint
  | string
  | {
  "chainId": number;
  "name": string;
};
```

A Networkish can be used to allude to a Network, by specifying:

- A [Network](/sdk/content/classes/Network) object
- A well-known (or registered) network name
- A well-known (or registered) chain ID
- An object with sufficient details to describe a network
