```ts
function getAddressDetails(address): AddressDetails | null
```

Extracts both zone and UTXO information from a given blockchain address. This function first determines the address's
zone by its byte prefix, then checks the 9th bit of the address to ascertain if it's a UTXO or non-UTXO address.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `address` | `string` | The blockchain address to be analyzed, expected to start with "0x" followed by its<br />  hexadecimal representation. |

## Returns

`AddressDetails` \| `null`

An object containing the zone and UTXO information, or null if no address is found.
