title: Run a Stratum Proxy
description: A guide on configuring, starting, and running a Stratum Proxy.
---

## Introduction

Here, we'll be installing [go-quai-stratum](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai-stratum), the Go implementation of the stratum proxy on Quai Network. This tutorial is focused on Linux Distributions and MacOS systems.

<Warning>Running go-quai-stratum on Windows or WSL2 is not currently supported.</Warning>

## Environment Setup

For the simplest installation process, we recommend installing and running go-quai-stratum on the same computer that you're running go-quai. Running go-quai-stratum on a separate computer is only recommended for advanced users as it requires additional networking configuration.

### Install Dependencies

To run an instance of go-quai-stratum, you'll need to install a few dependencies. You can install dependencies with your favorite package manager ([apt](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/package-management), [brew](https://brew.sh/), etc.).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go v1.23.0+">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Linux Snap Install">
    _Snap is not default installed on all Linux distros_
    ```bash
      # install snapd if you don't have it already
      sudo apt install snapd

      # install go
      sudo snap install go --classic
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="MacOS Install">
      Before installing go, make sure you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed as it is not installed by default on MacOS.
      ```bash
      brew install go
      ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>
  If you're not on Ubuntu or MacOS, instructions on how to install go directly can be found on the [golang installation page](https://go.dev/doc/install).
  </Step>
<Step title="Git, Make, and G++">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Linux Install">
        Install git, make, and g++ with the following command:
        ```bash
        # install git and make
        sudo apt install git make g++
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="MacOS Install">
        Install git and make with the following command:

        <Info>
          MacOS machines already have g++ installed.
        </Info>

        ```bash
        # install git and make
        brew install git make
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step title="go-quai-stratum">
    Now that you've installed the base dependencies, we can go ahead and clone the [go-quai-stratum repo](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai-stratum).

    To clone the go-quai-stratum repo and navigate to it, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai-stratum
    cd go-quai-stratum
    ```

    This command installs the _main branch_ to your local machine. Unless you intend to develop, you must checkout the latest _release_.

    You can find the latest release on the [go-quai-stratum releases page](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai-stratum/tags). Then, check out the latest release with:

    ```bash
    git checkout put-latest-release-here
    ```

    For example (this not the latest release, check the releases page for the latest release number):

    ```bash
    git checkout v01.2.3-rc.4
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

To run the Quai stratum proxy, you'll need to do some minor configuration. Start by copying the example configuration file to a local configuration file:

```bash
cp config/config.example.json config/config.json
```

This will copy the example config and create a new config file within the config directory.
Within the newly created `config.json` file, you'll be able to configure networking settings and other relevant variables:

## Running the Proxy

### Build

Before running the proxy, we need to build the source. You can build via Makefile by running the following command:

```bash
make go-quai-stratum
```

### Run

Now that we've built the source, we can start our proxy. We recommend using a process manager like tmux or screen to run the proxy.

To run the proxy, you'll need to select a shard to run against.

Start the proxy by changing `REGION-NAME` and `ZONE-NAME` to the corresponding or **chain names** for the region and zone your node is running.

```bash
./build/bin/go-quai-stratum --region=REGION-NAME --zone=ZONE-NAME
```

<Warning>
	**Running the proxy will only work for chains your node is validating state for**. Global nodes validate state for all chains, whereas
	slice nodes only validate state for the chains you specify.
</Warning>

Available options for `REGION-NAME` and `ZONE-NAME` can be found below. You must select a corresponding region and zone, e.g. cyprus and cyprus1.

| Chain Name | Type   | Chain Index | Stratum Run Flags                |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Cyprus     | Region |             | `--region=cyprus`                |
| Cyprus1    | Zone   | [0 0]       | `--region=cyprus --zone=cyprus1` |
| Cyprus2    | Zone   | [0 1]       | `--region=cyprus --zone=cyprus2` |

The proxy by default listens for miner connections on the `3333` port. You can change the port the proxy listens on by passing it in with the `--stratum` flag in the run command if you'd like.

```bash
./build/bin/go-quai-stratum --region=REGION-NAME --zone=ZONE-NAME --stratum=LISTENING-PORT
```

<Note>
	Changing the proxy listening port is useful for running multiple proxies on a single global node. If you're only mining on a single shard,
	there is no need to change the listening port.
</Note>

The proxy should begin streaming logs to the terminal that _look similar to below_.

```bash

```

**To stop the proxy, use CTRL+C in your terminal.**

After configuring and pointing your proxy at a shard, you're now ready to point a [GPU miner](/guides/miner) at it and start mining.
