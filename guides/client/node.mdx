### Requirements

<Note>
	Quai consists of many "slices," or execution shards, that work together to form an overarching network. A **global node** runs all of
	these slices, while a **slice node** runs only a single slice. Our team at Dominant Strategies recommends a **slice node** for the vast
	majority of users.
</Note>

To run a **global node** during the Iron Age Testnet, you'll need a MacOS or Ubuntu machine with the following specifications:

To run a **slice node** during the Iron Age Testnet, you'll need a MacOS or Ubuntu machine with the following specifications:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
	<Card
		icon='microchip'
		title='Fast CPU with 8+ cores'
	/>
	<Card

		title='10+ MBit/sec download Internet service'
	/>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
	The above hardware specifications are for when Quai Network is operating at no/low load. To see the required hardware specifications when
	Quai Network is operating at high/maximum load, visit the [Node Overview page](/client/node#node-types).
</Warning>

## Install Dependencies

To run an instance of go-quai, you'll need to install a few dependencies. You can install dependencies with your favorite package manager ([apt](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/package-management), [brew](https://brew.sh/), etc.). The following dependencies are required to run a node:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go v1.21.0+">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Linux Snap Install">
    _Snap is not default installed on all Linux distros_
    ```bash
      # install snapd if you don't have it already
      sudo apt install snapd

      # install go
      sudo snap install go --classic
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="MacOS Install">
      ```bash
      brew install go
      ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>
  If you're not on Ubuntu or MacOS, instructions on how to install go directly can be found on the [golang installation page](https://go.dev/doc/install).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Git & Make">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Linux Install">
        Install git and make with the following command:
        ```bash
        # install git and make
        sudo apt install git make
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="MacOS Install">
        Install git and make with the following command:
        ```bash
        # install git and make
        brew install git make
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="go-quai">
  Now that you've installed the base dependencies, we can go ahead and [clone the go-quai repo](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai).

To clone the go-quai repo and navigate to it, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai
cd go-quai
```

This command installs the _main branch_ to your local machine. Unless you intend to develop, you must checkout the latest _release_.

You can find the latest release on the [go-quai releases page](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai/tags). Then, check out the latest release with:

```bash
git checkout put-latest-release-here
```

For example (this not the latest release, check the releases page for the latest release number)

```bash
git checkout v1.2.3-rc.4
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Node Configuration

After you've successfully installed go-quai, you'll need to configure your node. The `network.env.dist` is a boilerplate node configuration file. Copy the boilerplate file into `network.env` so that we can create our own custom config.

```bash
cp network.env.dist network.env
```

The `network.env` file houses a number of important parameters that we will configure to run our node correctly. The variables listed below will need to be set correctly for every experience level.

- `COINBASE`: the address in each chain (location) that mining rewards are paid to. Note that there is one coinbase address per shard.
- `NETWORK`: the network (testnet, devnet, etc.) your node is running on.
- `SLICES`: the slices of the network that the node will run. Note that the default configuration is for a global node, and that this parameter must be modified to run a slice node.
- `ENABLE_ARCHIVE`: whether or not the node will run in archive mode. Note that archive mode is required during the iron age testnet.

<Note>This file also contains a number of more advanced parameters that _will not be covered_ in this article.</Note>

Open the config file in your favorite text editor or IDE.

- [vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

```bash
# edit network.env with nano
nano network.env

# open go-quai in vscode to edit network.env
code .

# edit network.env with vim
vim network.env
```

If you are mining, **replace the default coinbase addresses** below with your own for the chains that you intend to mine. You can generate addresses for each shard easily with [Pelagus Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pelagus-iron-age/gaegollnpijhedifeeeepdoffkgfcmbc) or [Koala Wallet](https://koalawallet.io/).

You must generate a unique address for each `COINBASE` that is maps to a shard, i.e. generate a Cyprus-1 address with Pelagus and set it as the `ZONE_0_0_COINBASE` below. Even if you do not plan to mine all the chains, you must still enter a unique address for each.

```makefile
# Replace addresses below with your addresses for each shard
ZONE_0_0_COINBASE=0x04a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19 # cyprus1
ZONE_0_1_COINBASE=0x21c7650E65b164B2ab645eAF1141b569B2c82Bd7 # cyprus2
ZONE_0_2_COINBASE=0x3e742F0AE63d62304153526A51EE8BF0531d1887 # cyprus3
ZONE_1_0_COINBASE=0x72c871f639ed156De0b97C1b533e2617730b7ec2 # paxos1
ZONE_1_1_COINBASE=0x755c3603c5688CF3105F1a1AfC11fa0e1981b03B # paxos2
ZONE_1_2_COINBASE=0x9fF7B1A33BB22b70F5fb78A420CEd9075C437c87 # paxos3
ZONE_2_0_COINBASE=0xb8094B2bc411942fd078D994Cc4e9418D6A5B071 # hydra1
ZONE_2_1_COINBASE=0xC83cb918dd9267a344B51f57e28e8cf977057E05 # hydra2
ZONE_2_2_COINBASE=0xF39E7d05B5A1a2F934cC43221383f29e4794c822 # hydra3
```

<Warning>
	If you do not replace the addresses in the `network.env` with Quai addresses you generate and hold the private keys for, you will not
	receive any mining rewards.
</Warning>

Make sure to set the `ENABLE_ARCHIVE` variable to `true` in your `network.env` file. This will ensure that your node is running in archive mode, which is required for the Iron Age Testnet. It is default set to `false`.

```bash
ENABLE_ARCHIVE=true
```

Set the `NETWORK` variable to the network you plan on running. Available network options can be found in the [network specifications page](/build/networks#important-links-and-specs).

Set the `SLICES` parameter to whichever slices of the network you would like to run.

### Router Configuration

In order to connect directly to peers in the network, you'll need to make sure the [peering ports](/client/node#networking-and-conventions) on your router are forwarded or externally accessible.

The easiest way to ensure the peering ports are forwarded on your router is to **enable the universal plug and play (UPNP) option on your router**. General information on how to enable UPNP for _multiple different types of routers_ can be found in [this article](https://www.lifewire.com/enable-upnp-on-a-router-5206124). If your router _is not covered in this article_, you may have to search for UPNP instructions for your specific model.

<Warning>
	If your router does not have UPNP or port-forwarding enabled, your node will return an error when starting and immediately stop running.
</Warning>

If your local router doesn't support UPNP and **you're port forwarding** or you're **setting up on a server (VPS/VDS)**, you'll need to configure a few variables in the Networking Variables section in your `network.env`.

```bash
# Networking Variables
ENABLE_NAT=true
EXT_IP=SERVER IP or WAN IP
```

Set `ENABLE_NAT` to true, and replace the placeholder for `EXT_IP` above with your public server or WAN IP address. This will allow for other nodes in the network to properly connect to your node.

Make sure to uncomment the `EXT_IP` line (i.e. remove the `#` from the beginning of the line).

## Starting a Node

### Build

To start the node, we first need to build the source. You can build via Makefile by running the following command:

```bash
make go-quai
```

### Start

Now that we've built the source, we need to decide which type of node to run. As detailed in the [Node Overview](/client/node#node-types) page, users **can opt for either a global node or slice node depending on individual use case and hardware.**

#### Run a Global Node

Global nodes validate all of the chains within Quai Network. To spin up a global node run:

```bash
make run
```

#### Run a Slice Node

Slice nodes run what is called a "slice" of Quai Network. A slice is a subset of the network that validates prime, one region, and one zone chain. In the codebase, a slice is identified by its [region and zone index](/client/node#networking-and-conventions). Region and zone indices are 0-indexed and range from 0-2.

To spin up a slice node, **you'll need to edit the `network.env` file to specify the slices you want to run**. Slice specification can be done by editing the `SLICES` variable, which is default set to run all slices in the network.

For example, if you wanted to run two slices, you would change `SLICES` to the following (replace the corresponding `INDEX` variables for your desired slices):

```bash
SLICES="[FIRST_REGION_INDEX FIRST_ZONE_INDEX],[SECOND_REGION_INDEX SECOND_ZONE_INDEX]"
```

After configuring the slices you'd like to run in your `network.env`, start your node using the same command by running:

```bash
make run
```

<Note>Running a slice node will start processes for all chains, but **only validate state** in the chains you specify.</Note>

This will start up your slice node with the slices specified in your `network.env`.

Node operators should self-select the slice least latent to them, in order to minimize their uncle rate and maximize network bandwidth. Providing an initial suggestion for geographic organization will expedite the minimization of latency.

## Other Node Operations

<AccordionGroup >
  <Accordion title="Check log output" icon="binary-circle-check">
  Starting a node will run all instances of go-quai in the background and create a directory named nodelogs. Outputs from the node will be piped to a context specific `.log` file inside of nodelogs. To view the log output for a specific location, use:

    ```bash
    tail -f nodelogs/prime.log
    # OR
    tail -f nodelogs/region-2.log
    # OR
    tail -f nodelogs/zone-0-0.log
    ```

    Checking the node logs output is the best way to _verify that your full node is running correctly_. You can also easily view node logs in your favorite IDE or text editor.

    The outputs of a node that has **started correctly** should look similar to below.

    ```log
    INFO [01-30|19:55:15.397] Starting Quai 0.1.0-pre.0 on local testnet
    INFO [01-30|19:55:15.414] Maximum peer count                       ETH=50 total=50

    INFO [01-30|19:55:17.727] Opened ancient database                  database=/Users/user/Library/Quai/local/zone-0-0/quai/chaindata/ancient readonly=false
    INFO [01-30|19:55:17.728] Writing custom genesis block
    ```

    **To stop log outputs to the terminal, you can use CTRL+C.**

    <Warning>Depending on what your node is currently doing, your logs may not look **exactly** the same as above.</Warning>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Checking sync progress" icon="rotate">
  If your node has started correctly, it will begin syncing chain state from peers. There are a few ways to check the progress of the sync.

    From the **command line**, we can run the following command(s) to print the list of blocks that have been appended. **Replace** `location-to-print-here.log` **with the file name of the logs you'd like to print**.

    ```bash
    # Print all appended blocks
    cat nodelogs/location-to-print-here.log | grep Appended

    # Continuously print new appended blocks
    tail -f nodelogs/location-to-print-here.log | grep Appended

    # Continuously print appended blocks across all chains
    tail -f nodelogs/* | grep Appended
    ```

    The output should look similar to below:

    ```bash
    INFO   [09-18|10:18:17.273] Appended new block                       number=[102 1934 40392] hash=0x0000067368b679ce7994dbd6e3dfe93a5e5fe16642a6083604fd405556836cbe difficulty=405369 uncles=0 txs=0 etxs=0 gas=0 gasLimit=5000000 root=0x7df4c77d1463a5e4c7d5f5446476e34df01cf14b6226b7d83ccab072bc302edc order=2 location=[0 0] elapsed=2.019ms

    ```

    **To check the progress of your node's sync, compare the number of the latest block output from the above command to the current height of the chain you're running on the** [**Quai node stats page**](https://stats.quai.network/).

    You can also check the progress of your node's sync using the **client JSON RPC API**. The `quai_syncing` API method can be used easily in the [Quai Postman Workspace](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/19820580/2s935iv7GU) or via the command line.

    <Warning>
      If your node temporarily stops appending during sync, do not stop it. Allow it to continue running, and only reach out for support if the
      node has not appended a block for over 1 hour.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Update" icon="folder-check">
    <Warning>
      Initiating the node update process while the node or manager are currently running could cause issues. Make sure to stop all processes
      before updating.
    </Warning>

    To update a node, first **make sure to kill all instances of go-quai** using the above stop command.

    After stopping the node, you should pull any updated code using:

    ```bash
    git fetch --all
    ```

    Checkout the [latest release of go-quai](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai/tags):

    ```bash
    git checkout put-latest-release-here
    ```

    Finally, rebuild the source using:

    ```bash
    make go-quai
    ```

    After pulling any new code and rebuilding the source, you can safely restart the node and continue running.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stop" icon="octagon-exclamation" iconType="solid">
    Stopping your node should be done any time you make changes to your config file or prior to shutting your machine down. A node instance can be terminated by running:

    ```bash
    make stop
    ```

    This will kill all instances of `go-quai` on your machine. This can sometimes take a few seconds to complete.

    <Note>If you're running a miner, running `make stop` will not work. You must kill the miner process prior to stopping the node.</Note>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reset and clear" icon="power-off">
    <Warning>
      Resetting your node and clearing your database will remove any state you have synced. This is a non-reversible action and any commands
      noted below should be utilized with caution.
    </Warning>

    Developers and node runners may find that situations arise where they need to completely clear your node of synced state or do a full reset in the case of an issue or bug. A full reset of a node involves stopping the node, clearing the current nodelogs, and removing all synced state.

    **Reminder, resetting your node is non-reversible and should only be done if you understand the implications of removing all synced state.**

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Linux">
        For **Linux Machines**, we'll remove the `nodelogs` directory and the base `.quai` directory which contains all synced state. To do this, run the following command:

        ```bash
        rm -rf nodelogs ~/.quai
        ```

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="MacOS">
        For **MacOS machines**, we'll use a different command to remove the same directories:

        ```bash
        rm -rf nodelogs ~/Library/Quai
        ```

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    After running the above command, the node has been fully reset and is ready to be restarted.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Download snapshot" icon="download">
    **You can download the latest official snapshot via torrent.** To get the torrent link, visit the [Quai Network Discord Announcements](https://discord.gg/YpuuAxmJc6) channel for details on the latest snapshot.

    There are two ways to download the snapshot via torrent:

    - Using Brave Browser
    - Using a CLI torrent client

    #### Using Brave Browser

    **Using Brave Browser is the simplest way to download the snapshot via torrent.** All you need to do is grab the torrent file link for the most recent snapshot from the Quai Network Discord Announcements channel and paste it into Brave Browser. This will take you to a torrent download page. From there, you can initiate the snapshot download.

    #### Using a CLI Torrent Client

    We recommend using an open source torrent client like [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) to download the snapshot. You can also use other torrent clients like [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/). To install Transmission and download the snapshot, follow the steps below:

    ```bash
    # Install transmission
    sudo apt-get install transmission-cli transmission-common transmission-daemon

    # Start transmission daemon
    transmission-daemon

    # Download snapshot - note the date in the file name, this will change with each snapshot
    transmission-remote -a quai_colosseum_backup-1-8-24.tar.zst.torrent

    # Check download progress
    transmission-remote  -l
    ```

    <Warning>
      The snapshot will be downloaded to the `~/Downloads` directory, **please leave it there if you have the space available as it helps speed
      up torrent downloads for other users**.
    </Warning>

    After your torrent client has finished downloading the snapshot, follow the instructions below to import the snapshot into your node.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Snapshot sync and archive" icon="hard-drive">
    To archive/backup your node's database you'll first need to **stop your node** by running `make stop`.

    Common reasons for backing up your node's database include:

    - Importing/exporting node database
    - Changing machines
    - Wiping the drive the database is stored on

    Common reasons for syncing from a snapshot/database include:

    - Reducing syncing times
    - Restarting a node on a new machine/drive

    <Warning>
      Please be aware that when you are syncing from a snapshot, you are trusting the contents of the snapshot. For your node to fully verify
      the network, you must sync from genesis.
