title: Run A Node
description: How to start and run a Quai Network node.
---

## Introduction

Here, we'll be installing [go-quai](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai), the Go implementation of Quai Network. This tutorial is focused on Linux distributions and MacOS systems.

<Warning>Running go-quai on Windows or WSL2 is not currently supported.</Warning>

### Requirements

Quai consists of many "slices," or execution shards, that work together to form an overarching network. A global node runs all of
these slices, while a slice node runs only a single slice. Running a slice node is recommended for most users.

To run a **global node** during the Golden Age Testnet, you'll need a MacOS or Linux machine with the following specifications:

To run a **slice node** during the Golden Age Testnet, you'll need a MacOS or Linux machine with the following specifications:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
	<Card
		icon='microchip'
		title='Fast CPU with 8+ cores'
	/>
	<Card

		title='Fast SSD with at least 1TB free space'
	/>
	<Card
		icon='signal-stream'
		title='10+ MBit/sec download Internet service'
	/>
</CardGroup>

## Install Dependencies

To run an instance of go-quai, you'll need to install a few dependencies. You can install dependencies with your favorite package manager ([apt](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/package-management), [brew](https://brew.sh/), etc.). The following dependencies are required to run a node:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go v1.23.0+">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Linux Snap Install">
    _Snap is not default installed on all Linux distros_
    ```bash
      # install snapd if you don't have it already
      sudo apt install snapd

      # install go
      sudo snap install go --classic
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="MacOS Install">
      Before installing go, make sure you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed as it is not installed by default on MacOS.
      ```bash
      brew install go
      ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>
  If you're not on Ubuntu or MacOS, instructions on how to install go directly can be found on the [golang installation page](https://go.dev/doc/install).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Git, Make, and G++">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Linux Install">
        Install git, make, and g++ with the following command:
        ```bash
        # install git and make
        sudo apt install git make g++
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="MacOS Install">
        Install git and make with the following command:

        <Info>
          MacOS machines already have g++ installed.
        </Info>

        ```bash
        # install git and make
        brew install git make
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step title="go-quai">
    Now that the dependencies are installed, we can clone the [go-quai repository](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai
    cd go-quai
    ```

    This command installs the _main branch_ to your local machine. Unless you intend to develop, you must checkout the latest _release_.

    You can find the latest release on the [go-quai releases page](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai/tags). Then, check out the latest release with (replace the `put-latest-release-here` with the latest release number):

    ```bash
    git checkout put-latest-release-here
    ```

    For example (**this is not the latest release**, check the releases page for the latest release number)

    ```bash
    git checkout v1.2.3
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Node Configuration

### Selecting a Node Type

There are two types of nodes in Quai: **Global** and **Slice** nodes.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Global Node" icon="cubes">
    **Global nodes** validate every shard in the network, i.e. Prime, all Region chains, and all Zone chains.

    _Running a global node is only recommended for users who_:

    - have more available computing power (strong CPU, more RAM, large SSD, etc.)
    - want to easily switch between shards for mining
    - want to provide chain data as an RPC service

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Slice Node" icon="cube">
    **Slice nodes** validate a "slice" of all shards in the network. A slice is defined as the smallest set of shards a node can validate trustlessly, i.e. the Prime chain, any one Region chain, and any one Zone chain under the selected Region chain. A slice node validates only the shards in that slice, and runs lighter non-validation processes for all other shards in the network.

    _Running a slice node is recommended for users that_:

    - have less available computing power (less RAM, small SSD, etc.)
    - are not switching their miners between shards
    - are not providing chain data as an RPC service

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Environment Variables

There are a few key variables required to run a Quai node. **They will be passed as arguments in the [start command](#start)**.

- `coinbases`: the addresses in each chain (location) that mining rewards are paid to. Note that you must have one address per slice you are running.
- `slices`: the slices of the network that the node will run.

<Note>There are a number of more advanced parameters that can be passed as arguments that _will not be covered_ in this article.</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Mining Addresses">
    Coinbases will be passed to the `start` command similar to below, with your own addresses for the chains that you intend to mine. You can generate addresses for each shard and ledger easily with [Pelagus Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pelagus/nhccebmfjcbhghphpclcfdkkekheegop).

    You must generate a **unique Quai and Qi address** for each `node.coinbase` entry that maps to a slice your node is running, i.e. generate a Cyprus-1 Quai and Qi address and add them to the `node.coinbases` flag if you're running the slice `[0 0]`. Miner tips and block rewards will be paid out to the addresses you specify.

    ```bash
    # single slice node running cyprus1
    # Cyprus1 Quai address + Cyprus1 Qi address
    --node.coinbases '0x0054A3FC5d077E06434357c151b4c498e82B8b75,0x00e4386689104a66aF0bcFB5719C55Ef847aad48'
    ```

    ```bash
    # multi slice node running cyprus 1 and 2
    # Cyprus1 Quai address + Cyprus1 Qi address
    # Cyprus2 Quai address + Cyprus2 Qi address
    --node.coinbases '0x0054A3FC5d077E06434357c151b4c498e82B8b75,0x00e4386689104a66aF0bcFB5719C55Ef847aad48,0x013767E39B4effFF385CeB45c6538332de853AB4,0x01B8923E2271988ae953e201A34fd224d0DE66D1'
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Mining Payout Token">
    As a miner, you have the choice of recieving block rewards in either [Quai](/learn/tokenomics/tokenomics-overview/quai) or [Qi](/learn/tokenomics/tokenomics-overview/qi) tokens. Because the can payout block rewards in both Quai and Qi, you must specify **both a Quai and Qi address** for each shard in the coinbases field.

    Now that we've pasted our coinbase addresses, we can re-order them for each shard to chose our payout token. While both addresses will recieve miner tips in their respective tokens, only one address will recieve block rewards.

    The order you supply them in determines whether they are your "Primary" or "Secondary" coinbase addresses. Primary and secondary coinbases are defined as follows:

    - **Primary Coinbase**: The first address supplied for a shard, for which block rewards and miner tips are paid to
    - **Secondary Coinbase**: The second address supplied for a shard, for which only miner tips are paid to

    Both of the examples below contain the exact same addresses, but in different orders. The difference in order changes the payout token of block rewards.

    ```bash
    # cyprus1 node with block payouts in quai
    # primary coinbase: quai address (0x0054...b75)
    # secondary coinbase: qi address (0x00e4...d48)
    --node.coinbases '0x0054A3FC5d077E06434357c151b4c498e82B8b75,0x00e4386689104a66aF0bcFB5719C55Ef847aad48'
    ```

    ```bash
    # cyprus1 node with block payouts in qi
    # primary coinbase: qi address (0x00e4...d48)
    # secondary coinbase: quai address (0x0054...b75)
    --node.coinbases '0x00e4386689104a66aF0bcFB5719C55Ef847aad48, 0x0054A3FC5d077E06434357c151b4c498e82B8b75'
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Slices">
    Set the `node.slices` flag in your run command to whichever slices of the network you would like to run. The number of slices you specify should match the number and order of addresses you specified in the `node.coinbases` flag.

    In the codebase, a slice is identified by its [region and zone index](/client/node#networking-and-conventions). Region and zone indices are 0-indexed and range from 0-2.

    ```bash
    # single slice node running cyprus1
    --node.slices '[0 0]'
    ```

    ```bash
    # multi slice node running cyprus 1 and 2
    --node.slices '[0 0],[0 1]'
    ```

    <Note>
      Running a slice node will start node processes for all chains, but **only validate state** in the chains you specify.
    </Note>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Starting a Node

### Build

To start the node, we first need to build the source. You can build via Makefile by running the following command:

```bash
make go-quai
```

<Info>
	We already already ran the above build command in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section. It is not required to run
	the build command again, but it can be a good practice, especially after pulling a new version or making your own changes.
</Info>

### Start

Now that we've built the source and set out our variable flags, we can combine them to start the node.

To start your node, run the start command with the added `node.coinbases` and `node.slices` flags that we covered above.

<Warning>
	The `node.coinbases` values below are set to dummy values. If you do not replace them with your own addresses, you will not recieve block
	rewards.
</Warning>

```bash
./build/bin/go-quai start --node.slices '[0 0]' --node.coinbases '0x0054A3FC5d077E06434357c151b4c498e82B8b75,0x00e4386689104a66aF0bcFB5719C55Ef847aad48'
```

This will spin up a node using the values of the `node.slices` and `node.coinbases` flags in your command. Logs should begin printing to the terminal.

### Stop

Stopping your node should be done any time you make changes to your config file or prior to shutting your machine down. A node instance can terminated using `CTRL+C`.

<Note>If you're running a miner, `CTRL+C` may not work. You must kill the miner process prior to stopping the node.</Note>

## Other Node Operations

<AccordionGroup >
  <Accordion title="Check log output" icon="binary-circle-check">
    Starting a node will run all instances of go-quai in the foreground and also create a directory named nodelogs to store more specific logs from the node. Outputs from the node will be piped to a context specific `.log` file inside of the nodelogs directory. To view the log output for a specific location, use:

    ```bash
    # view global logs (recommended)
    tail -f nodelogs/global.log

    # view specific region or zone logs
    tail -f nodelogs/region-0.log
    # OR
    tail -f nodelogs/zone-0-0.log
    ```

    Checking the node logs output is the best way to _verify that your full node is running correctly_. You can also easily view node logs in your favorite IDE or text editor.

    The outputs of a node that has **started correctly** should look similar to below.

    ```log
    INFO   [10-02|19:42:12.077] Loading config from file: /root/.config/go-quai/config.toml
    INFO   [10-02|19:42:12.108] Loading config from environment variables with prefix: 'GO_QUAI_'

    ```

    **To stop log outputs to the terminal, you can use CTRL+C.**

    <Warning>Depending on what your node is currently doing, your logs may not look **exactly** the same as above.</Warning>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Checking sync progress" icon="rotate">
  If your node has started correctly, it will begin syncing chain state from peers. There are a few ways to check the progress of the sync.

    From the **command line**, we can run the following command(s) to print the list of blocks that have been appended. **Replace** `location-to-print-here.log` **with the file name of the logs you'd like to print**.

    ```bash
    # Print all appended blocks
    cat nodelogs/location-to-print-here.log | grep Appended

    # Continuously print new appended blocks
    tail -f nodelogs/location-to-print-here.log | grep Appended

    # Continuously print appended blocks across all chains
    tail -f nodelogs/* | grep Appended
    ```

    The output should look similar to below:

    ```bash

    ```

    **To check the progress of your node's sync, compare the number of the latest block output from the above command to the current height of the chain you're running on the** [**Quai node stats page**](https://stats.quai.network/).

    <Warning>
      If your node temporarily stops appending during sync, do not stop it. Allow it to continue running, and only reach out for support if the
      node has not appended a block for over 1 hour.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Update" icon="folder-check">
    <Warning>
      Initiating the node update process while the node or manager are currently running could cause issues. Make sure to stop all processes before updating.
    </Warning>

    To update a node, first **make sure to stop all instances of go-quai** before proceeding.

    After stopping the node, you should pull any updated code using:

    ```bash
    git fetch --all
    ```

    Checkout the [latest release of go-quai](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai/tags):

    ```bash
    git checkout put-latest-release-here
    ```

    Finally, rebuild the source using:

    ```bash
    make go-quai
    ```

    After pulling any new code and rebuilding the source, you can safely restart the node and continue running.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reset and clear" icon="power-off">
    <Warning>
      Resetting your node and clearing your database will remove any state you have synced. This is a non-reversible action and any commands noted below should be utilized with caution.
    </Warning>

    Developers and node runners may find that situations arise where they need to completely clear your node of synced state or do a full reset in the case of an issue or bug. A full reset of a node involves stopping the node, clearing the current nodelogs, and removing all synced state.

    **Reminder, resetting your node is non-reversible and should only be done if you understand the implications of removing all synced state.**

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Linux">
        For **Linux Machines**, we'll remove the `nodelogs` directory and the base `~/.local/share/go-quai` directory which contains all synced state. To do this, run the following command:

        ```bash
        rm -rf nodelogs ~/.local/share/go-quai
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="MacOS">
        For **MacOS machines**, we'll use a different command to remove the same directories:

        ```bash
        rm -rf nodelogs ~/Library/Application\ Support/go-quai
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    After running the above command, the node has been fully reset and is ready to be restarted.
