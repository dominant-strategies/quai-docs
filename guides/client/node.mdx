title: Run A Node
description: How to start and run a Quai Network node.
---

## Introduction

Here, we'll be installing go-quai, the Go implementation of Quai Network. This tutorial is focused on Linux distributions and MacOS systems.

<Warning>Running go-quai on Windows or WSL2 is not currently supported.</Warning>

### Requirements

Quai consists of many "slices," or execution shards, that work together to form an overarching network. A global node runs all of
these slices, while a slice node runs only a single slice. Running a slice node is recommended for most users.

To run a **global node** during the Iron Age Testnet, you'll need a MacOS or Ubuntu machine with the following specifications:

To run a **slice node** during the Iron Age Testnet, you'll need a MacOS or Ubuntu machine with the following specifications:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
	<Card
		icon='microchip'
		title='Fast CPU with 8+ cores'

		title='10+ MBit/sec download Internet service'
	/>
</CardGroup>

## Install Dependencies

To run an instance of go-quai, you'll need to install a few dependencies. You can install dependencies with your favorite package manager ([apt](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/package-management), [brew](https://brew.sh/), etc.). The following dependencies are required to run a node:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go v1.22.0+">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Linux Snap Install">
    _Snap is not default installed on all Linux distros_
    ```bash
      # install snapd if you don't have it already
      sudo apt install snapd

      # install go
      sudo snap install go --classic
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="MacOS Install">
      ```bash
      brew install go
      ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>
  If you're not on Ubuntu or MacOS, instructions on how to install go directly can be found on the [golang installation page](https://go.dev/doc/install).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Git & Make">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Linux Install">
        Install git and make with the following command:
        ```bash
        # install git and make
        sudo apt install git make
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="MacOS Install">
        Install git and make with the following command:
        ```bash
        # install git and make
        brew install git make
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="go-quai">
    Now that the dependencies are installed, we can clone the [go-quai repository](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai
    cd go-quai
    ```

    This command installs the _main branch_ to your local machine. Unless you intend to develop, you must checkout the latest _release_.

    You can find the latest release on the [go-quai releases page](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai/tags). Then, check out the latest release with:

    ```bash
    git checkout put-latest-release-here
    ```

    For example (this not the latest release, check the releases page for the latest release number)

    ```bash
    git checkout v1.2.3-rc.4
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Node Configuration

### Selecting a Node Type

There are two types of nodes in Quai: **Global** and **Slice** nodes.

**Global nodes** validate every shard in the network, i.e. Prime, all Region chains, and all Zone chains. Running a global node is only recommended for users who:

- have more available computing power (strong CPU, more RAM, large SSD, etc.)
- want to easily switch between shards for mining
- want to provide chain data as an RPC service

**Slice nodes** validate a "slice" of all shards in the network. A slice is defined as the smallest set of shards a node can validate trustlessly, i.e. the Prime chain, any one Region chain, and any one Zone chain under the selected Region chain. A slice node validates only the shards in that slice, and runs lighter non-validation processes for all other shards in the network. Running a slice node is recommended for users who:

- have less available computing power (less RAM, small SSD, etc.)
- are not switching their miners between shards
- are not providing chain data as an RPC service

### Environment Variables

After you've successfully installed go-quai, you'll need to configure your node. Go-quai uses a `config.toml` file to configure the node. The `config.toml` file is not located in the `go-quai` but rather in a directory at the root of your machine.

The `config.toml` file houses a number of important parameters that we will configure to run our node correctly. The variables listed below will need to be set correctly for every experience level.

- `environment`: the network (testnet, devnet, etc.) your node is running on.
- `coinbases`: the addresses in each chain (location) that mining rewards are paid to. Note that you must have one address per slice you are running.
- `slices`: the slices of the network that the node will run.

<Note>This file also contains a number of more advanced parameters that _will not be covered_ in this article.</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Config File">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Linux">
        Open the `config.toml` file with your favorite text editor.

        ```bash
        # edit with nano
        nano ~/.config/go-quai/config.toml

        # open in vscode to edit
        cd ~/.config/go-quai/
        code .

        # edit network.env with vim
        vim ~/.config/go-quai/config.toml
        ```

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="MacOS">
        Open the `config.toml` file with your favorite text editor.

        ```bash
        # edit with nano
        nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/go-quai/config.toml

        # open in vscode to edit
        cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/go-quai/
        code .

        # edit network.env with vim
        vim ~/Library/Application\ Support/go-quai/config.toml
        ```

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
    <Step title="Set Environment">
    Set the `environment` variable to the network you plan on running. Available network options can be found in the [network specifications page](/build/networks#important-links-and-specs).

    ```toml
    environment = 'colosseum'
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Mining Addresses">
    If you are mining, **insert the coinbase addresses** similar to below with your own for the chains that you intend to mine. You can generate addresses for each shard easily with [Pelagus Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pelagus/nhccebmfjcbhghphpclcfdkkekheegop) or [Koala Wallet](https://koalawallet.io/).

    You must generate a unique address for each `coinbase` entry that maps to a slice your node is running, i.e. generate a Cyprus-1 address and paste it in the `coinbases` field if you're running the slice `[0 0]`. You must enter a unique address for each additional entry.

    ```toml
    [global node]
    coinbases = '0x00a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19,0x01a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19,0x02a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19,0x10a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19,0x11a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19,0x12a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19,0x20a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19,0x21a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19,0x22a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19'

    [single slice node]
    coinbases = '0x00a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19'

    [multi slice node (3 slices)]
    coinbases = '0x00a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19,0x01a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19,0x02a3e45aa16163F2663015b6695894D918866d19'
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Slices">
    Set the `slices` parameter to whichever slices of the network you would like to run. The number of slices you specify should match the number and order of addresses you specified in the `coinbases` field.

    In the codebase, a slice is identified by its [region and zone index](/client/node#networking-and-conventions). Region and zone indices are 0-indexed and range from 0-2.

    ```toml
    [global node]
    slices = '[0 0],[0 1],[0 2],[1 0],[1 1],[1 2],[2 0],[2 1],[2 2]'

    [single slice node]
    slices = '[0 0]'

    [multi slice node (3 slices)]
    slices = '[0 0],[0 1],[0 2]'
    ```

    <Note>
      Running a slice node will start node processes for all chains, but **only validate state** in the chains you specify.
    </Note>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Starting a Node

### Build

To start the node, we first need to build the source. You can build via Makefile by running the following command:

```bash
make go-quai
```

### Start

Now that we've built the source, we need to decide which type of node to run. As detailed in the [Node Overview](/client/node#node-types) page, users **can opt for either a global node or slice node depending on individual use case and hardware.**

To start your node, simply run:

```bash
./build/bin/go-quai start
```

This will spin up a node using the configuration we set in the `config.toml` file. Logs should begin printing to the terminal.

### Stop

Stopping your node should be done any time you make changes to your config file or prior to shutting your machine down. A node instance can terminated using `CTRL+C`.

<Note>If you're running a miner, `CTRL+C` may not work. You must kill the miner process prior to stopping the node.</Note>

### Latency Optimization

Node operators should self-select the slice least latent to them (geographically closest to them). This will help maximize their mining rewards, minimize uncle rate, and reduce communication time between nodes.

Below is an initial suggestion for geographic organization, which will generally expedite the minimization of latency.

## Other Node Operations

<AccordionGroup >
  <Accordion title="Check log output" icon="binary-circle-check">
    Starting a node will run all instances of go-quai in the foreground and also create a directory named nodelogs to store more specific logs from the node. Outputs from the node will be piped to a context specific `.log` file inside of the nodelogs directory. To view the log output for a specific location, use:

    ```bash
    # view global logs (recommended)
    tail -f nodelogs/global.log

    # view specific region or zone logs
    tail -f nodelogs/region-2.log
    # OR
    tail -f nodelogs/zone-0-0.log
    ```

    Checking the node logs output is the best way to _verify that your full node is running correctly_. You can also easily view node logs in your favorite IDE or text editor.

    The outputs of a node that has **started correctly** should look similar to below.

    ```log
    INFO [01-30|19:55:15.397] Starting Quai 0.1.0-pre.0 on local testnet
    INFO [01-30|19:55:15.414] Maximum peer count                       ETH=50 total=50

    INFO [01-30|19:55:15.461] Allocated cache and file handles         database=/Users/user/Library/Quai/local/zone-0-0/quai/chaindata cache=512.00MiB handles=5120
    INFO [01-30|19:55:17.727] Opened ancient database                  database=/Users/user/Library/Quai/local/zone-0-0/quai/chaindata/ancient readonly=false
    INFO [01-30|19:55:17.728] Writing custom genesis block
    ```

    **To stop log outputs to the terminal, you can use CTRL+C.**

    <Warning>Depending on what your node is currently doing, your logs may not look **exactly** the same as above.</Warning>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Checking sync progress" icon="rotate">
  If your node has started correctly, it will begin syncing chain state from peers. There are a few ways to check the progress of the sync.

    From the **command line**, we can run the following command(s) to print the list of blocks that have been appended. **Replace** `location-to-print-here.log` **with the file name of the logs you'd like to print**.

    ```bash
    # Print all appended blocks
    cat nodelogs/location-to-print-here.log | grep Appended

    # Continuously print new appended blocks
    tail -f nodelogs/location-to-print-here.log | grep Appended

    # Continuously print appended blocks across all chains
    tail -f nodelogs/* | grep Appended
    ```

    The output should look similar to below:

    ```bash
    INFO   [09-18|10:18:17.273] Appended new block                       number=[102 1934 40392] hash=0x0000067368b679ce7994dbd6e3dfe93a5e5fe16642a6083604fd405556836cbe difficulty=405369 uncles=0 txs=0 etxs=0 gas=0 gasLimit=5000000 root=0x7df4c77d1463a5e4c7d5f5446476e34df01cf14b6226b7d83ccab072bc302edc order=2 location=[0 0] elapsed=2.019ms

    ```

    **To check the progress of your node's sync, compare the number of the latest block output from the above command to the current height of the chain you're running on the** [**Quai node stats page**](https://stats.quai.network/).

    <Warning>
      If your node temporarily stops appending during sync, do not stop it. Allow it to continue running, and only reach out for support if the
      node has not appended a block for over 1 hour.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Update" icon="folder-check">
    <Warning>
      Initiating the node update process while the node or manager are currently running could cause issues. Make sure to stop all processes before updating.
    </Warning>

    To update a node, first **make sure to stop all instances of go-quai** before proceeding.

    After stopping the node, you should pull any updated code using:

    ```bash
    git fetch --all
    ```

    Checkout the [latest release of go-quai](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai/tags):

    ```bash
    git checkout put-latest-release-here
    ```

    Finally, rebuild the source using:

    ```bash
    make go-quai
    ```

    After pulling any new code and rebuilding the source, you can safely restart the node and continue running.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reset and clear" icon="power-off">
    <Warning>
      Resetting your node and clearing your database will remove any state you have synced. This is a non-reversible action and any commands noted below should be utilized with caution.
    </Warning>

    Developers and node runners may find that situations arise where they need to completely clear your node of synced state or do a full reset in the case of an issue or bug. A full reset of a node involves stopping the node, clearing the current nodelogs, and removing all synced state.

    **Reminder, resetting your node is non-reversible and should only be done if you understand the implications of removing all synced state.**

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Linux">
        For **Linux Machines**, we'll remove the `nodelogs` directory and the base `~/.local/share/go-quai` directory which contains all synced state. To do this, run the following command:

        ```bash
        rm -rf nodelogs ~/.local/share/go-quai
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="MacOS">
        For **MacOS machines**, we'll use a different command to remove the same directories:

        ```bash
        rm -rf nodelogs rm -rf ~/Library/Application Support/go-quai
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    After running the above command, the node has been fully reset and is ready to be restarted.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Download snapshot" icon="download">
    **You can download the latest official snapshot via torrent.** To get the torrent link, visit the [Quai Network Discord Announcements](https://discord.gg/YpuuAxmJc6) channel for details on the latest snapshot.

    There are two ways to download the snapshot via torrent:

    - Using Brave Browser
    - Using a CLI torrent client

    #### Using Brave Browser

    **Using Brave Browser is the simplest way to download the snapshot via torrent.** All you need to do is grab the torrent file link for the most recent snapshot from the Quai Network Discord Announcements channel and paste it into Brave Browser. This will take you to a torrent download page. From there, you can initiate the snapshot download.

    #### Using a CLI Torrent Client

    We recommend using an open source torrent client like [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) to download the snapshot. You can also use other torrent clients like [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/). To install Transmission and download the snapshot, follow the steps below:

    ```bash
    # Install transmission
    sudo apt-get install transmission-cli transmission-common transmission-daemon

    # Start transmission daemon
    transmission-daemon

    # Download snapshot - note the date in the file name, this will change with each snapshot
    transmission-remote -a quai_colosseum_backup-1-8-24.tar.zst.torrent

    # Check download progress
    transmission-remote  -l
    ```

    <Warning>
      The snapshot will be downloaded to the `~/Downloads` directory, **please leave it there if you have the space available as it helps speed
      up torrent downloads for other users**.
    </Warning>

    After your torrent client has finished downloading the snapshot, follow the instructions below to import the snapshot into your node.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Snapshot sync and archive" icon="hard-drive">
    To archive/backup your node's database you'll first need to **stop your node**.

    Common reasons for backing up your node's database include:

    - Importing/exporting node database
    - Changing machines
    - Wiping the drive the database is stored on

    Common reasons for syncing from a snapshot/database include:

    - Reducing syncing times
    - Restarting a node on a new machine/drive
