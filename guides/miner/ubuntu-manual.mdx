title: Ubuntu Manual Installation
description: Manually install and run a Quai GPU miner on Ubuntu with either OpenCL or CUDA.
---

<Warning>
	Running a GPU miner on an Ubuntu based Virtual Machine may not work properly as the VM has no access to the GPU on your native OS. This
	includes most VMs that run on top of Windows or WSL2.
</Warning>

## Introduction

Here, we'll be installing quai-gpu-miner, the main implementation of a Quai Network GPU miner. This tutorial focuses on installing and running **quai-gpu-miner on** [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), an enterprise and open source Linux distribution.

<Warning>
	If you are mining for Testnet Rewards, be sure to **keep the private keys of the accounts you mine into**. Signing transactions from the
	accounts you mine into (using their private keys) will be the only acceptable way to prove how many blocks you mined in the Iron Age
	Testnet when it is time to claim Mainnet rewards.
</Warning>

### Requirements

In order to run the quai-gpu-miner on Ubuntu 20.04 and mine valid blocks, you'll need the following:

## Environment Setup

### Ubuntu

To run the quai-gpu-miner, you'll first need to install and configure Ubuntu v20.04. The quai-gpu-miner **is not compatible for compilation with Ubuntu v22 or higher**. Instructions on how to download and install Ubuntu on your machine can be found on the [Ubuntu installation instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview).

Compatible Version Download: [Ubuntu v20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/).

<Warning>
	If you'd like to run the GPU miner on Ubuntu v22.04, you'll need to compile the binaries on Ubuntu v20.04 first and run them on the newer
	version OS.
</Warning>

### Dependencies

Prior to installing any dependencies, you'll first want to make sure the system is up to date. We can do this by running:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CUDA Dependencies">
    After Ubuntu has updated, we can begin installing the following dependencies:

    - `git`
    - `cmake`
    - `build-essential`
    - `mesa-common-dev`
    - `nvidia-driver-535`
    - Nvidia CUDA Toolkit v12.1

    Install dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y git cmake build-essential mesa-common-dev nvidia-driver-535
    ```

    Install CUDA with the following commands:

    ```bash
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.1.0/local_installers/cuda_12.1.0_530.30.02_linux.run
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo sh cuda_12.1.0_530.30.02_linux.run
    ```

    The above command will open a flow where you are able to select which components of the CUDA Toolkit you'd like to install. Ensure your selections are IDENTICAL to the image below.

    <Frame>
      <img src='/images/CUDAINSTALLEROPTIONS.jpeg' />
    </Frame>

    Unselect "Driver", and only select "CUDA Toolkit 12.1".

    <Note>
      After completing this step, you may see a warning saying that the CUDA compatible drivers were not installed -- as long as you previously
      installed `nvidia-driver-535`, you can safely ignore this warning.
    </Note>

    After installing dependencies, reboot your machine to ensure all updates are applied correctly.

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenCL Dependencies">
   After Ubuntu has updated, we can begin installing the following dependencies:

    - `git`
    - `cmake`
    - `build-essential`
    - `mesa-common-dev`
    - `nvidia-driver-535`

    Install all dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y git cmake build-essential mesa-common-dev nvidia-driver-535
    ```

    After installing dependencies, reboot your machine to ensure all updates are applied correctly.

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Build and Run

Now that the environment and dependencies are fully configured, we can start installing `quai-gpu-miner`.

First, make sure you're in the home directory for the correct user. You can do this by running:

```bash
sudo su user -
```

:::Note
replace "user" with the target user you want to switch to
:::

Now, clone the `quai-gpu-miner` and navigate to the `quai-gpu-miner` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner && cd quai-gpu-miner
```

To install and update external repository dependencies, run the following:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This will ensure that all the submodules referenced in the repository are **properly initialized** and **up to date**.

### Build

Start by making a directory named `build` and navigating to it:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

Once inside of the build directory, we'll need to install all of the build dependencies using `cmake` and then build and compile the miner shown below.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CUDA">
    For CUDA, run the following with `DETHASHCUDA=ON`:

    ```bash
    cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=ON && cmake --build .
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenCL">
    For OpenCL, run the following:

    ```bash
    cmake .. && cmake --build .
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
	Running this command may take a while to complete, and will require about 10gb of RAM. If you don't have enough RAM on your rig to
	compile, some users have had success compiling on a different machine and sending the compiled binary to the rig.
</Warning>

### Run

To run the miner, you'll need a quai-stratum-proxy to connect to. Visit the [quai-stratum-proxy](/guides/client/stratum) docs for information on how to install and configure it. The proxy configuration will determine which shard your gpu-miner is running on and the address payouts are awarded to.

First, you'll need to obtain the IP Address and port your proxy is running on. The default port is `3333`.

Once you have the address and port and are in the `build` directory, run the following command to start the miner:

```bash
./ethcoreminer/ethcoreminer -G -P stratum://PROXYIPADDRESS:STRATUMPORT
```

The quai-gpu-miner should now be running and outputting logs to the terminal.

<Warning>
	Do not start the miner before confirming your node has fully synced. Mining while your node is not synced will result in the mining of
	**invalid blocks** and **wasted hash**.
</Warning>

### Stop

To stop the miner, simple use **CTRL+C** to kill the terminal process. Once logs are no longer being outputted to the terminal, the miner has stopped.
