title: HiveOS Flight Sheet Installation
description: Install and run a Quai Network GPU miner on HiveOS using a Flight Sheet.
---

## Introduction

Here, we'll be installing [quai-gpu-miner](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner), the implementation of a Quai Network ProgPOW miner. This tutorial focuses on installing and running quai-gpu-miner on [HiveOS](https://hiveon.com/os/) using a [Flight Sheet](https://hiveon.com/knowledge-base/guides/fs/). HiveOS also provides a web based dashboard for streamlined management and maintenance of your Quai Network GPU miner.

<Warning>
	Be sure to **keep the private keys of the accounts you mine into**. Signing a message from the accounts you mine into will be required to
	claim Mainnet rewards.
</Warning>

### Requirements

In order to run the quai-gpu-miner on HiveOS and mine valid blocks, you'll need the following:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
	<Card
		title='Synced go-quai node'
		href='/guides/client/node'
		icon='computer'
	/>
	<Card
		title=' configured Stratum proxy'
		href='/guides/client/stratum'
		icon='router'
	/>
	<Card
		title='HiveOS machine'
		icon='hive'
	/>
	<Card
		title='NVIDIA GPU'
		icon='microchip'
	/>
	<Card
		title='4GB+ of RAM'
		icon='usb-drive'
	/>
</CardGroup>

## Environment Setup

### HiveOS

For this tutorial, you'll need a HiveOS machine. Instructions for how to install HiveOS on your rig and configure it can be found on the [HiveOS installation documentation](https://hiveon.com/install/).

### Dashboard

Once you've installed HiveOS, configure your GPU workers into a Farm. Once configured, you'll be able to manage workers from a [HiveOS dashboard](https://hiveon.com/knowledge-base/getting_started/start_dashboard_setup/) and utilize Flight Sheets.

## Installation

<Warning>
	At the moment, Quai Flight Sheets are only configured for NVIDIA graphics cards. If you're using an AMD card, you'll need to use the
	[manual installation](/guides/miner/hiveos) until a compatible Flight Sheet is available.
</Warning>

To start the Flight Sheet installation, open up your [HiveOS Farm Dashboard](https://the.hiveos.farm/).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Wallet">
    In the **farm menu**, click "wallets".

    </Frame>

    Fill in the wallet information:
    - For the **Coin** field, type "Quai" then click on "Create Quai" in the drop-down menu.
    - In the **Address** field, copy/paste your Quai wallet address. (This address is not used by the miner, so you can put any address here.)
    - For **Name** field, choose a name for your wallet.

    To finish creating the wallet, click "Create" in the bottom right corner.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Flight Sheet">
    In the **farm menu**, click "flight sheets".

    <Frame>
      <img src='/images/FlightSheet/FS4.jpg' />
    </Frame>

    Click "add flight sheet". Fill out the flight sheet information:

    - For the **Miner name**, type "quai_custom".
    - For the **Installation URL**, copy the [Quai Flight Sheet URL](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/releases/download/v0.2.0/quai-gpu-miner-v0.2.0.tar.gz).
    - For the **Hash algorithm**, type "progpow".
    - For the **Wallet and worker template**, type "%WAL%.%WORKER_NAME%".
    - For the **Pool URL**, type "stratum://EXTERNALIPADDRESS:PORT".
    - For the **Extra config arguments**, use `-U --HWMON 1 -P stratum://EXTERNALIPADDRESS:PORT` for NVIDIA cards.

    On bottom right corner, click "Apply Changes".
