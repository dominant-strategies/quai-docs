title: HiveOS Manual Installation
description: Manually install and run a Quai GPU miner on HiveOS with either OpenCL or CUDA.
---

## Introduction

Here, we'll be installing quai-gpu-miner, the main implementation of a Quai Network GPU miner.

This tutorial focuses on installing and running quai-gpu-miner on [HiveOS](https://hiveon.com/os/), a Linux based operating system that makes GPU mining easy. HiveOS also provides a web based dashboard for **streamlined management and maintenance of your Quai Network GPU miner**.

<Warning>
	If you are mining for Testnet Rewards, be sure to **keep the private keys of the accounts you mine into**. Signing transactions from the
	accounts you mine into (using their private keys) will be the only acceptable way to prove how many blocks you mined in the Iron Age
	Testnet when it is time to claim Mainnet rewards.
</Warning>

### Requirements

In order to run the quai-gpu-miner on HiveOS and mine valid blocks, you'll need the following:

## Environment Setup

### HiveOS

To run the quai-gpu-miner, you'll first need to install and configure HiveOS. Instructions on how to install HiveOS on your rig and configure it can be found on the [HiveOS install documentation](https://hiveon.com/install/).

<Note>
	The recommended method of installing and building the miner in HiveOS is [with the provided script](/guides/miner/hiveos-auto). The manual
	installation is only recommended for users needing more customization regarding drivers/packages.
</Note>

### Drivers and Updates

Once you've installed and set up HiveOS on your rig, you'll need to update drivers, install some GPU utility packages, and ensure Hive is up to date.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CUDA Drivers">
    Prior to starting updates and installs, we need to switch users. Do this by running:

    ```bash
    sudo su user
    ```

    To upgrade HiveOS, run:

    ```bash
    sudo selfupgrade
    ```

    To update and install necessary graphics card drivers, run:

    ```bash
    sudo nvidia-driver-update
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenCL Drivers">
    Prior to starting updates and installs, we need to switch users. Do this by running:

    ```bash
    sudo su user
    ```

    To upgrade HiveOS, run:

    ```bash
    sudo selfupgrade
    ```

    To update and install necessary graphics card drivers, run:

    ```bash
    sudo nvidia-driver-update
    ```

    Once drivers have been installed and updated, we'll need to install OpenCL:

    ```bash
    sudo amd-ocl-install 22.20
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Dependencies

Prior to installing any dependencies, you'll first want to make sure the system is up to date. We can do this by running:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CUDA Dependencies">
   After HiveOS has updated, we can begin installing the following dependencies:

    - `git`
    - `cmake`
    - `build-essential`
    - `mesa-common-dev`
    - [Nvidia CUDA Toolkit v12.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive)

    Install dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y git cmake build-essential mesa-common-dev
    ```

    Finally, after installing all necessary dependencies and drivers, reboot your machine to ensure all updates are applied correctly using:

    Install CUDA with the following commands:

    ```bash
    # Download CUDA Toolkit
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.1.0/local_installers/cuda_12.1.0_530.30.02_linux.run

    # Run CUDA Installation Script
    sudo sh cuda_12.1.0_530.30.02_linux.run --silent --toolkit
    ```

    <Info>
      After completing this step, you may see a warning saying that the CUDA compatible drivers were not installed -- as long as you previously
      ran `nvidia-driver-update`, you can safely ignore this warning.
    </Info>

    After installing CUDA, reboot your machine to ensure all updates are applied correctly using:

    ```bash
    sreboot
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenCL Dependencies">
    After Ubuntu has updated, we can begin installing the following dependencies:

    - `git`
    - `cmake`
    - `build-essential`
    - `mesa-common-dev`

    Install all dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y git cmake build-essential mesa-common-dev
    ```

    Finally, after installing all necessary dependencies and drivers, reboot your machine to ensure all updates are applied correctly using:

    ```bash
    sreboot
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Build and Run

Now that the environment and dependencies are fully configured, we can start installing `quai-gpu-miner`.

First, make sure you're in the home directory for the correct user. You can do this by running:

```bash
sudo su user -
```

Now, clone the `quai-gpu-miner` and navigate to the `quai-gpu-miner` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner && cd quai-gpu-miner
```

To install and update external repository dependencies, run the following:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This will ensure that all the submodules referenced in the repository are **properly initialized** and **up to date**.

### Build

Start by making a directory named `build` and navigating to it:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

Inside of the build directory, we'll need to install all of the build dependencies using `cmake` and then build and compile the miner:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CUDA">
    For CUDA, run the following with `DETHASHCUDA=ON`:

    ```bash
    cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=ON && cmake --build .
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenCL">
    For OpenCL, run the following:

    ```bash
    cmake .. && cmake --build .
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
	Running this command may take a while to complete, and will require about 10gb of RAM. If you don't have enough RAM on your rig to
	compile, some users have had success compiling on a different machine and sending the compiled binary to the rig.
</Warning>

### Run

To run the miner, you'll need a quai-stratum-proxy to connect to. Visit the [quai-stratum-proxy](/guides/client/stratum) docs for information on how to install and configure it. The proxy configuration will determine which shard your gpu-miner is running on and the address payouts are awarded to.

First, you'll need to obtain the IP Address and port your proxy is running on. The default port is `3333`.

Once you have the address and port and are in the `build` directory, run the following command to start the miner:

```bash
./ethcoreminer/ethcoreminer -G -P stratum://PROXYIPADDRESS:STRATUMPORT
```

The quai-gpu-miner should now be running and outputting logs to the terminal.

<Warning>
	Do not start the miner before confirming your node has fully synced. Mining while your node is not synced will result in the mining of
	**invalid blocks** and **wasted hash**.
</Warning>

### Stop

To stop the miner, simple use **CTRL+C** to kill the terminal process. Once logs are no longer being outputted to the terminal, the miner has stopped.

<Note>
	When running on HiveOS, you can use a **community-built flight sheet** ([for NVIDIA
	cards](https://quai-gpu-releases.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/quai_custom-0.3.3.amd.tar.gz) or [for AMD
	cards](https://quai-gpu-releases.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/quai_custom-0.3.2.tar.gz)) to easily manage your miner.
</Note>
