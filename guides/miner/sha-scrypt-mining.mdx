description: Mine Quai Network with SHA and Scrypt ASICs using the SOAP upgrade.
---

With the Subsidized Open-market Acquisition Protocol (SOAP) upgrade, Quai Network is now mineable by SHA and Scrypt ASICs. Project SOAP takes Quai from being solely GPU mined with ProgPoW to multi-algo mined with SHA, Scrypt, and KawPoW.

## Why Mine Quai?

### More Profitable

With the new addition of SHA and Scrypt, mining Quai will be more profitable than mining Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin+DOGE, or Ravencoin.

Not only will Quai Network be more profitable, Quai Network will be more sustainable long term for miners given the unique buyback mechanism from the SOAP upgrade.

### Low Switching Costs

Switching to mine Quai Network with SHA or Scrypt hashrate is as simple as generating a Quai Network address and pointing your hardware to a Quai Network mining pool.

### Less Miner Competition

In traditional mining, where increased hashrate due to competition has a negative impact on value due to more miners selling rewards to cover costs, SOAP mining introduces a buy-back mechanism to neutralize that sell pressure. This creates a net-neutral impact to token value in a worst case scenario, and positive pressure in all other cases. The more hashrate that enters the network, the more buy-backs occur via Project SOAP.

## How to SOAP Mine Quai in Two Steps

### 1. Generate a Quai Network Address

You can generate a Quai address by visiting the Google Chrome store to download the Pelagus wallet or generate a Quai address in Tangem.

### 2. Point your SHA or Scrypt ASIC at a Quai Network mining pool

A variety of pools for both SHA256 and SCRYPT miners are available, as well as GPU miners who are interested in KawPow.
