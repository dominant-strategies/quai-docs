<Warning>
	Running a GPU miner on an Ubuntu based Virtual Machine may not work properly. This includes most VMs that run on top of Windows or WSL2.
</Warning>

## Introduction

Here, we'll be installing [quai-gpu-miner](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner), the implementation of a Quai Network ProgPOW miner. This tutorial will focus on installing and running quai-gpu-miner on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), an enterprise and open source Linux distribution.

### Requirements

In order to run the quai-gpu-miner on Ubuntu and mine valid blocks, you'll need the following:

## Environment Setup

### Ubuntu

For this tutorial, you'll need an Ubuntu machine. Instructions on how to download and install Ubuntu on your machine can be found on the [Ubuntu installation instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview).

### Miner Installation

Start by installing the GPU Miner. There is a single installation option for Ubuntu machines:

- Compile and install from source via [automated script](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/blob/main/miner_deploy.sh)

The [quai-gpu-miner](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner) repository contains a [automated script](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/blob/main/deploy_miner.sh) that can be used to compile and build the miner. The `deploy_miner.sh` script will install the following build dependencies and build the latest version of the miner:

- git
- cmake
- build-essential
- mesa-common-dev
- [Nvidia CUDA Toolkit v12.6](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-6-0-download-archive)

To download the script, run the following command:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/refs/heads/main/deploy_miner.sh
```

Once the download is complete, make the `deploy_miner.sh` file executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x deploy_miner.sh
```

Run the script with the following command:

<Warning>
	Running this command will compiling and build the miner. This process may take a while to complete, and requires around 10gb of RAM.
</Warning>

```bash
sudo ./deploy_miner.sh
```

This will create an `output` directory with the built `quai-gpu-miner` binary in it. Make the `quai-gpu-miner` file executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x output/quai-gpu-miner
```

### Dependencies and Drivers

Now that we've installed and built the miner, we need to make sure our system and drivers are up to date.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Then, install NVIDIA drivers:

```bash
# if you're running on a non-server OS
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535

# if you're running on a server OS
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535-server
```

To apply the NVIDIA drivers updates, restart your machine with:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Configure And Run

To run the miner, you'll need a Stratum proxy to connect to. Visit the [quai-stratum-proxy](/guides/client/stratum) docs for information on how to install and configure it. The proxy configuration will determine which shard your gpu-miner is running on and the address payouts are awarded to.

First, you'll need to obtain the IP Address and port your proxy is running on from the Stratum proxy logs. The default port is `3333`.

Once you've obtained the IP Address and port, run the miner with the following command, making sure to replace `PROXYIPADDRESS` with the IP Address and `STRATUMPORT` with the port your proxy is running on:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CUDA">
  ```bash
  ./output/quai-gpu-miner -U -P stratum://PROXYIPADDRESS:STRATUMPORT
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenCL">
  ```bash
  ./output/quai-gpu-miner -G -P stratum://PROXYIPADDRESS:STRATUMPORT
  ```
  
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The quai-gpu-miner should now be running and outputting logs to the terminal.

<Warning>
	Do not start the miner before confirming your node has fully synced. Mining while your node is not synced will result in the mining of
	**invalid blocks** and **wasted hash**.
</Warning>

### Stop

To stop the miner, simple use **CTRL+C** to kill the terminal process. Once logs are no longer being outputted to the terminal, the miner has stopped.
