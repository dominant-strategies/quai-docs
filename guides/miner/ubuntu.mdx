<Warning>
	Running a GPU miner on an Ubuntu based Virtual Machine may not work properly. This includes most VMs that run on top of Windows or WSL2.
</Warning>

## Introduction

Here, we'll be installing [quai-gpu-miner](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner), the implementation of a Quai Network ProgPOW miner. This tutorial will focus on installing and running quai-gpu-miner on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), an enterprise and open source Linux distribution.

</CardGroup>

## Environment Setup

### Ubuntu

To run the quai-gpu-miner, you'll first need to install and configure Ubuntu. Instructions on how to download and install Ubuntu on your machine can be found on the [Ubuntu installation instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview).

### Dependencies

Prior to installing any dependencies, you'll first want to make sure the system is up to date. We can do this by running:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Depending on whether your machine has Nvidia or AMD graphics cards, you'll need to install the appropriate dependencies.

- NVIDIA graphics cards utilize CUDA
- AMD graphics cards utilize OpenCL

Select the appropriate dependency installation tab below based on your hardware.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CUDA Dependencies">
   After HiveOS has updated, we can begin installing the following dependencies:

    - `git`
    - `cmake`
    - `build-essential`
    - `mesa-common-dev`
    - [Nvidia CUDA Toolkit v12.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive)

    Install dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y git cmake build-essential mesa-common-dev
    ```

    Install CUDA with the following commands:

    ```bash
    # Download CUDA Toolkit
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.1.0/local_installers/cuda_12.1.0_530.30.02_linux.run

    # Run CUDA Installation Script
    sudo sh cuda_12.1.0_530.30.02_linux.run --silent --toolkit
    ```

    <Info>
      After completing this step, you may see a warning saying that the CUDA compatible drivers were not installed -- as long as you previously
      ran `nvidia-driver-update`, you can safely ignore this warning.
    </Info>

    After installing CUDA, reboot your machine to ensure all updates are applied correctly using:

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenCL Dependencies">
   After Ubuntu has updated, we can begin installing the following dependencies:

    - `git`
    - `cmake`
    - `build-essential`
    - `mesa-common-dev`
    - `nvidia-driver-535`

    Install all dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y git cmake build-essential mesa-common-dev nvidia-driver-535
    ```

    After installing dependencies, reboot your machine to ensure all updates are applied correctly.

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Installation

Now that all of our dependencies are installed, we can install quai-gpu-miner. There are two options for installation:

- Install [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/releases)
- Compile and install from source via [automated script](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/blob/main/miner_deploy.sh)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pre-compiled Binaries">
    <Tip>
      Installing the GPU miner via pre-compiled binaries is recommended for vast majority of users. It is the simplest and fastest way to get started mining.
    </Tip>

    The latest release of quai-gpu-miner is available for download from the [GPU miner releases page](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/releases).

    To download the binaries for the latest release into the `output` directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo wget -P output https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/releases/latest/download/quai-gpu-miner
    ```

    This will create a built `quai-gpu-miner` file in the `output` directory. Make `quai-gpu-miner` executable by running:

    ```bash
    chmod +x output/quai-gpu-miner
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Compile from Source">
    <Warning>
      Compiling from source may take a while to complete, and will require about 10gb of RAM. If your machine does not have the required RAM, it is recommend to install via pre-compiled binaries.
    </Warning>

     The [quai-gpu-miner](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner) repository contains a [automated script](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/blob/main/miner_deploy.sh) that can be used to compile and configure the miner.

     To download the script, run the following command:

     ```bash
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/refs/heads/main/miner_deploy.sh
     ```

     Make the `miner_deploy.sh` file executable:

     ```bash
     chmod +x miner_deploy.sh
     ```

     To compile and configure the miner, run the script with the following command:

     ```bash
     sudo ./miner_deploy.sh
     ```

     This will create an `output` directory with the built `quai-gpu-miner` binary in it. Make the `quai-gpu-miner` file executable:

     ```bash
     chmod +x output/quai-gpu-miner
     ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure And Run

To run the miner, you'll need a quai-stratum-proxy to connect to. Visit the [quai-stratum-proxy](/guides/client/stratum) docs for information on how to install and configure it. The proxy configuration will determine which shard your gpu-miner is running on and the address payouts are awarded to.

First, you'll need to obtain the IP Address and port your proxy is running on. The default port is `3333`.

Once you've obtained the IP Address and port, run the miner with the following command, making sure to replace `PROXYIPADDRESS` with the IP Address and `STRATUMPORT` with the port your proxy is running on:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CUDA">
  ```bash
  ./output/quai-gpu-miner -U -P stratum://PROXYIPADDRESS:STRATUMPORT
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenCL">
  ```bash
  ./output/quai-gpu-miner -G -P stratum://PROXYIPADDRESS:STRATUMPORT
  ```
  
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The quai-gpu-miner should now be running and outputting logs to the terminal.

<Warning>
	Do not start the miner before confirming your node has fully synced. Mining while your node is not synced will result in the mining of
	**invalid blocks** and **wasted hash**.
</Warning>

### Stop

To stop the miner, simple use **CTRL+C** to kill the terminal process. Once logs are no longer being outputted to the terminal, the miner has stopped.
