<Warning>
	Running a GPU miner on an Ubuntu based Virtual Machine may not work properly. This includes most VMs that run on top of Windows or WSL2.
</Warning>

## Introduction

Here, we'll be installing [quai-gpu-miner](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner), the implementation of a Quai Network ProgPOW miner. This tutorial will focus on installing and running quai-gpu-miner on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), an enterprise and open source Linux distribution.

### Requirements

In order to run the quai-gpu-miner on Ubuntu and mine valid blocks, you'll need the following:

</CardGroup>

## Environment Setup

### Ubuntu

To run the quai-gpu-miner, you'll first need to install and configure Ubuntu. Instructions on how to download and install Ubuntu on your machine can be found on the [Ubuntu installation instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview).

### Dependencies and Drivers

Prior to installing any dependencies, you'll first want to make sure the system is up to date. We can do this by running:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Install NVIDIA drivers:

```bash
# if you're running on a non-server OS
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535

# if you're running on a server OS
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535-server
```

## Installation

Now that all of our dependencies are installed, we can install quai-gpu-miner. There are two options for installation:

- Install [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/releases)
- Compile and install from source via [automated script](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/blob/main/miner_deploy.sh)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pre-compiled Binaries">
    <Tip>
      Installing the GPU miner via pre-compiled binaries is recommended for vast majority of users. It is the simplest and fastest way to get started mining.
    </Tip>

    The latest release of quai-gpu-miner is available for download from the [GPU miner releases page](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/releases).

    To download the binaries for the latest release into the `output` directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo wget -P output https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/releases/latest/download/quai-gpu-miner
    ```

    This will create a built `quai-gpu-miner` file in the `output` directory. Make `quai-gpu-miner` executable by running:

    ```bash
    chmod +x output/quai-gpu-miner
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Compile from Source">
    <Warning>
      Compiling from source may take a while to complete, and will require about 10gb of RAM. If your machine does not have the required RAM, it is recommend to install via pre-compiled binaries.
    </Warning>

     The [quai-gpu-miner](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner) repository contains a [automated script](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/blob/main/miner_deploy.sh) that can be used to compile and configure the miner.

     To download the script, run the following command:

     ```bash
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner/refs/heads/main/miner_deploy.sh
     ```

     This script will install the following build dependencies and build the latest version of the miner:

     - `git`
     - `cmake`
     - `build-essential`
     - `mesa-common-dev`
     - [Nvidia CUDA Toolkit v12.6](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-6-0-download-archive)

     Make the `miner_deploy.sh` file executable:

     ```bash
     chmod +x miner_deploy.sh
     ```

     To compile and configure the miner, run the script with the following command:

     ```bash
     sudo ./miner_deploy.sh
     ```

     This will create an `output` directory with the built `quai-gpu-miner` binary in it. Make the `quai-gpu-miner` file executable:

     ```bash
     chmod +x output/quai-gpu-miner
     ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure And Run

To run the miner, you'll need a quai-stratum-proxy to connect to. Visit the [quai-stratum-proxy](/guides/client/stratum) docs for information on how to install and configure it. The proxy configuration will determine which shard your gpu-miner is running on and the address payouts are awarded to.

First, you'll need to obtain the IP Address and port your proxy is running on. The default port is `3333`.

Once you've obtained the IP Address and port, run the miner with the following command, making sure to replace `PROXYIPADDRESS` with the IP Address and `STRATUMPORT` with the port your proxy is running on:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CUDA">
  ```bash
  ./output/quai-gpu-miner -U -P stratum://PROXYIPADDRESS:STRATUMPORT
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenCL">
  ```bash
  ./output/quai-gpu-miner -G -P stratum://PROXYIPADDRESS:STRATUMPORT
  ```
  
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The quai-gpu-miner should now be running and outputting logs to the terminal.

<Warning>
	Do not start the miner before confirming your node has fully synced. Mining while your node is not synced will result in the mining of
	**invalid blocks** and **wasted hash**.
</Warning>

### Stop

To stop the miner, simple use **CTRL+C** to kill the terminal process. Once logs are no longer being outputted to the terminal, the miner has stopped.
