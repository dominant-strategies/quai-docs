# QI: Cash-Like Privacy

**QI** is one of two native tokens on Quai Network.  
Its design goal is to serve as a **crypto-native medium of exchange and unit of account** for a global monetary system.  
To achieve that, **privacy** must be a core design feature.

This document explains the **privacy architecture of QI**, the **two key properties** that enable *cash-like privacy*, and why privacy is an essential property of any scalable monetary system.

---

## Why Privacy Matters

In a global economy, privacy is not optional ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **foundational requirement** for free trade and open markets.

Privacy preserves both **individual dignity** and **societal fairness**:

- **For individuals:** Safeguards financial autonomy, allowing users to choose *who* they transact with, *what* they spend, and *when* they do it ‚Äî free from coercion or surveillance.  
- **For organizations:** Prevents unfair competitive intelligence and industrial espionage.  
- **For society:** Upholds democratic processes by preventing systemic monitoring and censorship.  

In short, **privacy is a shield for freedom, competition, and innovation.**  
A truly global, decentralized economy must protect privacy *by design*, not as an afterthought.

<Callout>
üí° If we are to build a new global monetary system, privacy must be baked in by default ‚Äî not left as an afterthought.
</Callout>

## Cash-Like Privacy

At Quai Network, we describe **QI** as having *cash-like privacy* because it mirrors the privacy dynamics of physical cash.

> **Example:** When you pay with cash, both parties know the transaction occurred and agree on the amount.  
> However:
> - The merchant doesn‚Äôt know how much money you still have.  
> - You don‚Äôt know how much cash the merchant has.  
> - Observers can confirm a transaction occurred but cannot trace where the cash came from or where it ends up.

This is **transparency without traceability** ‚Äî a property QI achieves through its unique ledger design.

## The QI Ledger Privacy Model

**QI** operates on a **[UTXO ledger](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction#Input_and_Output)**, similar to Bitcoin‚Äôs, but with two key differences:

1. **Enforced Non-Address Reuse**  
2. **Fixed Denominations**

These modifications to the traditional UTXO model make QI transactions private *by default* while maintaining global scalability.

---

### 1. Enforced Non-Address Reuse

On the QI ledger, **addresses cannot be reused.**

Every transaction to a recipient must generate a **unique address**, requiring wallets to implement **[Payment Codes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki)** ‚Äî a type of public key derivation mechanism.

- Each sender uses the recipient‚Äôs payment code to derive a **new, unique address**.  
- Observers cannot link multiple transactions to the same recipient.  
- The recipient‚Äôs internal account (the wallet controlling spendable UTXOs) remains hidden.  

<Callout>
üí° *Payment Codes enable reusable identities with unique transaction addresses, providing privacy without requiring interactive key exchange.*
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
‚ö†Ô∏è One address may be reused once per prime block for UTXO consolidation, improving efficiency while maintaining privacy.
</Callout>

---

### 2. Fixed Denominations

While non-reuse hides *who* is transacting, **fixed denominations** hide *how much* and *where it goes*.

Unlike Bitcoin, which supports 100 million *satoshis* per BTC (creating traceable patterns), **QI** limits the system to just **16 fixed denominations**.

This design means:

- Transaction outputs all resemble one another.  
- ‚ÄúChange‚Äù outputs blend seamlessly into the network.  
- Chain analysis becomes practically infeasible.  

Together, **enforced non-address reuse** and **fixed denominations** make QI transactions **effectively untraceable**.

---

## Untraceable Money at Scale

These two properties combine to create **untraceable, cash-like digital money** that scales globally.

- Transactions are transparent ‚Äî anyone can see they occurred.  
- But they are untraceable ‚Äî no one can link them to real-world identities or balances.

This makes QI a **true decentralized and private medium of exchange**, preserving user privacy while maintaining verifiable on-chain integrity.

---

## Privacy vs. Anonymity

It‚Äôs important to distinguish **privacy** from **anonymity**:

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Privacy** | Control over what information is shared | Paying with cash ‚Äî the merchant knows the transaction occurred but not your balance |
| **Anonymity** | Complete removal of identifiable data | Using [CoinJoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin) or a mixer to hide both sender and receiver |

By design, **QI** is **not fully anonymous**, but provides a **default level of privacy** sufficient for global commerce.

For users who require deeper anonymity, QI supports **[Schnorr Signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature)** for multi-party transactions.  
Wallets can implement **CoinJoin-style** mechanisms to further obfuscate transaction origins.

## Comparing QUAI, WQI, and QI Privacy

| Token | Ledger Type | Privacy Level | Description |
|--------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| **QUAI** | Account-based | Transparent | Standard Quai account transactions |
| **WQI** | Wrapped (Account-based) | Transparent | Wrapped QI for smart contract use |
| **QI** | UTXO-based | Cash-like Privacy | Private-by-default medium of exchange |

<Callout type="warning">
‚ö†Ô∏è Swaps between QUAI, WQI, and QI are **transparent**.  
To achieve full cash-like privacy, transact only in **native QI**.
</Callout>
