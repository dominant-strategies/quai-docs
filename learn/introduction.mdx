Quai Network is a next-generation blockchain that merges the security of Proof-of-Work with unprecedented scalability. 

At its core, Quai introduces three breakthrough innovations:
- **Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM)**: A consensus mechanism that eliminates block contention and enables instant finality
- **Merged-mined hierarchy**: Allows Quai to scale state processing without dividing mining power while creating optimally organized subnets
- **Energy-based currency (Qi)**: The world's first decentralized dollar tied to the cost of energy

Together, these innovations create a blockchain capable of serving as a global monetary system—secure, scalable, and built for real-world commerce.

## Unleashed Scalability

**Quai keeps transaction fees permanently low by automatically expanding capacity to meet demand.**

Think of Quai as a highway system that automatically adds new lanes as traffic increases. Through [Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM)](/learn/advanced-introduction/poem/poem), Quai can coordinate multiple parallel processing chains ([execution shards](/learn/advanced-introduction/poem/sharding/execution-sharding)) while maintaining perfect consensus.

Key benefits:
- **Dynamic scaling**: The network automatically adds processing power as demand grows
- **Low fees forever**: More users means more capacity, not higher costs
- **Trustless interoperability**: All shards are seamlessly connected through [miner-validated bridges](/learn/advanced-introduction/merged-mining/coincident-blocks)

The only tradeoff is [slightly longer settlement times](/learn/advanced-introduction/poem/sharding/dynamic-sharding#time-to-global-settlement) when transacting across distant shards—a small price for unlimited scalability.

## Energy-Based Stable Currency

**Unlike traditional stablecoins that rely on collateral or algorithms, Qi derives its stability from the universal constant of energy costs.**

How it works:
- Proof-of-Work mining acts as an [oracle for real-world energy prices](/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/token-dynamics)
- The protocol automatically adjusts [Qi supply](/learn/tokenomics/qi-emissions) based on mining costs
- [Market incentives](/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/token-dynamics) naturally drive Qi's value toward the cost of energy

Just as a kilowatt-hour has consistent value worldwide, Qi aims to be a universal unit of value. This makes Qi ideal for:
- **Global commerce**: No currency conversion or volatility risk
- **AI economies**: Energy is the primary input for computation
- **Pricing goods, services, and contracts**: Stable purchasing power over time

Energy is the single largest input to both human activity and artificial intelligence. By anchoring currency to energy, Quai creates money that's inherently valuable to both humans and machines.

Quai Network joins protocols like [Hacash](https://hacash.money/) and [Themelio](https://docs.melproject.org/concepts/melmint) in pioneering this new category of energy-based currencies.

<Note>
**Why This Matters**

Current blockchains force users to choose between:
- **Security** (Bitcoin) or **functionality** (Ethereum)
- **Decentralization** or **low fees**
- **Stable value** or **trustless operation**

Quai eliminates these tradeoffs by combining Proof-of-Work security with unlimited scalability and energy-based stability.
