# Quai Network

Quai Network is a scalable and programmable Proof-of-Work blockchain designed to serve as a new global monetary system. By merging currency with energy, Quai delivers the world’s first decentralized energy dollar, Qi. Qi is stable, scalable, and built for real-world commerce. Quai leverages a next-generation Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Entropy-Minima to eliminate block contention and provide lightning fast finality.

## Energy-Based “Stablecoin”

Within Quai, Proof-of-Work is used not only to secure the network from attackers, but also to function as an [oracle for real-world demand and energy costs](/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/token-dynamics), allowing for the creation of a completely [decentralized “stablecoin” tied to energy](/learn/tokenomics/qi-emissions). This token is not pegged to or backed by any asset, but rather exclusively uses [market incentives](/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/token-dynamics) to consistently drive the token’s price towards the cost of energy.

Energy is the single largest input to both human activity and artificial intelligence. The intrinsic value of energy to both man and machine makes it an ideal foundation for a new currency to be built upon.

Quai Network joins protocols like [Hacash](https://hacash.money/) and [Themelio](https://docs.melproject.org/concepts/melmint) as a leader in the emerging category of decentralized Proof-of-Work “stablecoins.”

## Unleashed Scalability

Through the use of a new Proof-of-Work fork-choice rule named [Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM)](/learn/advanced-introduction/poem/poem), Quai Network is able to remain in consensus while coordinating enough [execution shards](/learn/advanced-introduction/poem/sharding/execution-sharding) to support all of global commerce. This property allows Quai Network to dynamically add shards to the network as needed in order to meet perpetually growing demand. The only tradeoff to adding shards to Quai (and thus increasing throughput) is an [increased time to cross-shard settlement](/learn/advanced-introduction/poem/sharding/dynamic-sharding#time-to-global-settlement).

Trustless bridging between all shards in the network is achieved by [using miners to create objective links between shards](/learn/advanced-introduction/merged-mining/coincident-blocks).

Quai Network’s native, pre-defined scaling creates a mechanism for congestion to be alleviated as demand increases, keeping fees permanently low even with growing usage.
