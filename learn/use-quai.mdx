## Mine Quai

### Home Mining
Run a mining node from your personal computer or dedicated mining rig to earn rewards while supporting network decentralization. When mining with your own node, you can:

- **Choose your reward token**: Earn either QUAI or QI based on your preference
- **Opt for Locked Mining Rewards (LMR)**: Earn up to 25% additional rewards by deferring payment for 3, 6, or 12 months

[Learn how to run a node](/guides/client/node).

### Mining Pools

Join a mining pool to mine without having to run a node:

| Pool | Fee | Payout Scheme | Min Payout | Features |
|------|-----|---------------|------------|----------|
| [F2Pool](https://f2pool.com) | 1% | PPLNS | 1 QUAI | Major pool, 14-day maturity |
