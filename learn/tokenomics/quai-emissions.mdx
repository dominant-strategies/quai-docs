title: Quai Emissions
---

Traditional cryptocurrency networks often implement predetermined emission schedules, such as Bitcoin's fixed 21 million supply curve. While these models provide predictability, they can lead to cyclical boom-bust patterns that slows sustained network adoption.

The primary objective of a deflationary monetary policy is to maintain an inflation rate that remains below the network's growth rate. This creates a natural scarcity dynamic where the proportional supply expansion is consistently outpaced by network growth.

## Network Value Growth

Network systems value is theorized to initially grow at n² which turns into an n*log(n) growth rate at maturity.

## Market Driven Mechanics

A deflationary emission curve should ensure that the inflation of the token supply is always less than the growth in network value. We have chosen a lograthmic emission curve which is always less than the hypothetical n² and n*log(n) value growth curves.

Rather than implementing time-based emission schedules, the protocol allows market dynamics to determine the aggregate supply of both QUAI and QI tokens. This supply is influenced by:

- Market price discovery
- Network hashrate
- Relative token utility

By allowing market forces to determine emission rates, growth trajectories, and price discovery, the system creates more efficient market dynamics compared to arbitrary time-based emission schedules. This approach enables the network to:

1. Adapt to changing market conditions
2. Optimize resource allocation
3. Better reflect true network value
4. Reduce artificial supply shocks

This market-driven approach creates a more organic and sustainable economic model for the network's long-term growth.

## Genesis Allocations

A pre-allotted amount of 3 billion Quai will be generated as part of the genesis block.

## Quai Block Rewards

Quai rewards are issued in proportion to the “bits” of difficulty that a valid block hash achieved, approximately represented by the number of leading zeros in the target value.

$$
Block Reward_{Quai}  ∝ log_{2}(Difficulty)
$$

Note that there is a proportionality constant/variable in the Quai [block reward](/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/block-rewards/block-rewards) function above. It is currently set at 221077819000000000.
This proportinality variable will evolve with the launch of Qi, becoming more dynamic through the controller system for Quai/Qi conversions.

## Quai Supply

The supply of Quai is determined by the following formula:

$$
Supply_{Quai} = (Genesis_{Quai}) + ∑(Emissions_{Quai}) ± ∑(Conversions_{Quai})
$$

The block reward function only defines how many Quai tokens can _potentially_ be emitted. Actual, realized supply emissions from block rewards are determined by the choices miners must make to receive only either Quai or Qi, a selection they may change going forward at any time.

In addition to the effects from this new flow of Quai and/or Qi issuance, the respective supply stock of Quai is affected by the initial genesis allocation of Quai and the [conversion feature between existing Qi and Quai](/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/conversions/conversions) at the current block mining rewards ratio (e.g. between the # of Quai tokens/block and # of Qi tokens/block), which is accessible to anyone -- not just miners.

As such, the supply of Quai at any given time is the cumulative result of the genesis allocation, [miner-selected emissions](/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/block-rewards/block-rewards), and [token conversions](/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/conversions/conversions).


These illustrative examples assume:

- Miners take 100% of block reward in Quai rather than any in Qi, and that there is no net effect of conversions between the two.
- Varying network difficulty growth rates based on Bitcoin’s growth:
  - **Example 1**: Bitcoin’s growth from 2011 through 2023, extrapolating that same growth rate over an additional 7 years.
  - **Example 2**: Bitcoin’s growth from 2011 through 2023, but spreads it out over 20 years.
  - **Example 3**: Bitcoin’s growth between 2011 through 2016, spread out over 20 years.

These examples also take into account the 3 billion initial Quai tokens minted and allocated in the genesis block.

Assuming the growth of Example 3 growth rate, the following chart shows the projected supply numbers of Quai assuming no demand for Qi i.e. worst case over a 10 year time frame.
At 4 year, it would project 50% of the supply would be mined tokens and at year 10 70% of the supply would be mined tokens.
