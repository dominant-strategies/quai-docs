## Rethinking Token Emissions

Traditional cryptocurrencies use fixed emission schedules - Bitcoin's famous 21 million cap being the prime example. While predictable, these rigid schedules often create artificial scarcity that leads to boom-bust cycles. When supply is fixed regardless of demand, prices can swing wildly, hindering practical adoption.

Imagine if the Federal Reserve had to set money supply for the next 100 years today, regardless of economic growth or changing conditions. That's essentially what fixed emission schedules do - they ignore market realities in favor of mathematical predictability.

**The Deflationary Challenge:**
For a store-of-value token to succeed long-term, its inflation rate must stay below the network's growth rate. This creates natural scarcity where demand growth outpaces supply growth, driving sustainable value appreciation. The key is balancing scarcity with market responsiveness.

**Quai's Market-Driven Approach:**
Instead of arbitrary time-based schedules, Quai lets market dynamics determine supply. The emission rate responds to real network conditions: hashrate, price discovery, and actual demand. This creates a more organic relationship between network growth and token supply.

## Network Value Theory & Emission Design

**Network Value Growth Patterns:**
Research suggests that network systems typically follow predictable value growth patterns:
- **Early stage**: Explosive n² growth as network effects compound
- **Mature stage**: Steady n×log(n) growth as expansion becomes more efficient

Understanding these patterns is crucial for designing sustainable tokenomics.

**The Logarithmic Solution:**
Quai uses a logarithmic emission curve that stays consistently below both the n² and n×log(n) growth curves. This ensures that no matter which growth phase the network is in, token inflation remains below value creation - maintaining deflationary pressure.

**Market-Responsive Mechanics:**
Unlike fixed schedules, Quai's supply responds to real market conditions:

**Key Variables:**
- **Price discovery**: Market determines fair value based on utility and demand
- **Network hashrate**: Security level reflects true network value
- **Token utility**: Actual usage drives sustainable demand

**Adaptive Benefits:**
This market-driven approach creates several advantages:
1. **Adaptive supply**: Responds to changing network conditions
2. **Efficient allocation**: Resources flow where they're most valuable
3. **True value reflection**: Supply matches actual network utility
4. **Reduced volatility**: Eliminates artificial supply shocks from fixed schedules

The result is an economic model that grows organically with the network, avoiding the boom-bust cycles that plague fixed-supply tokens.

## Genesis Allocations: Fair Launch Foundation

Quai Network launches with a carefully structured initial allocation of 3 billion tokens. Unlike many projects that heavily favor insiders, Quai's distribution prioritizes long-term network development and community growth.

The genesis allocation balances several critical needs: funding continued development, rewarding early supporters, ensuring market liquidity, and building a robust ecosystem. Each allocation category has specific vesting schedules designed to align incentives with network success.

## Quai Block Rewards

Quai rewards are issued in proportion to the “bits” of difficulty that a valid block hash achieved, approximately represented by the number of leading zeros in the target value.

$$
Block Reward_{Quai}  ∝ log_{2}(Difficulty)
$$

Note that there is a proportionality constant/variable in the Quai [block reward](/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/block-rewards/block-rewards) function above. It is currently set at 221077819000000000.
This proportinality variable will evolve with the launch of Qi, becoming more dynamic through the controller system for Quai/Qi conversions.

## Quai Supply

The supply of Quai is determined by the following formula:

$$
Supply_{Quai} = (Genesis_{Quai}) + ∑(Emissions_{Quai}) ± ∑(Conversions_{Quai})
$$

The block reward function only defines how many Quai tokens can _potentially_ be emitted. Actual, realized supply emissions from block rewards are determined by the choices miners must make to receive only either Quai or Qi, a selection they may change going forward at any time.

In addition to the effects from this new flow of Quai and/or Qi issuance, the respective supply stock of Quai is affected by the initial genesis allocation of Quai and the [conversion feature between existing Qi and Quai](/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/conversions/conversions) at the current block mining rewards ratio (e.g. between the # of Quai tokens/block and # of Qi tokens/block), which is accessible to anyone -- not just miners.

As such, the supply of Quai at any given time is the cumulative result of the genesis allocation, [miner-selected emissions](/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/block-rewards/block-rewards), and [token conversions](/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/conversions/conversions).


These illustrative examples assume:

- Miners take 100% of block reward in Quai rather than any in Qi, and that there is no net effect of conversions between the two.
- Varying network difficulty growth rates based on Bitcoin’s growth:
  - **Example 1**: Bitcoin’s growth from 2011 through 2023, extrapolating that same growth rate over an additional 7 years.
  - **Example 2**: Bitcoin’s growth from 2011 through 2023, but spreads it out over 20 years.
  - **Example 3**: Bitcoin’s growth between 2011 through 2016, spread out over 20 years.

These examples also take into account the 3 billion initial Quai tokens minted and allocated in the genesis block.

Assuming the growth of Example 3 growth rate, the following chart shows the projected supply numbers of Quai assuming no demand for Qi i.e. worst case over a 10 year time frame.
At 4 year, it would project 50% of the supply would be mined tokens and at year 10 70% of the supply would be mined tokens.
