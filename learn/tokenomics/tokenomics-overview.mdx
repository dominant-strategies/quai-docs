# Quai & Qi

The Quai Network protocol has two different native tokens: [Quai](/learn/tokenomics/quai-emissions) & [Qi](/learn/tokenomics/qi-emissions).

Quai is an EVM-compatible, deflationary token that is designed to be a store-of-value.

Qi is a stable token linked to the price of energy, or simply an energy dollar. Qi is a fixed denomination UTXO based token with cash-like privacy properties. Qi can be used as a unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange in Quai Network.

Together, Quai and Qi provide all the of the necessary characteristics to create a decentralized global monetary system. i.e. a **store-of-value, unit-of-account, and medium-of-exchange.**

## Token Names
Quai (pronounced “k-why”) comes from the character 块, which roughly translates as a colloquial word for money, equivalent to “buck” or “quid” in English.

Qi (pronounced “chee”) comes from the character 气, referring to a concept of "energy" or "life force".
