title: Which Language To Use
description: Smart contract development languages supported on Quai Network.
---

## Overview

Quai Network runs a modified Ethereum Virtual Machine environment that provides internal _and_ cross-chain smart contract execution across zone chains in the network. Each chain's EVM is capable of executing smart contracts written in Solidity, SolidityX, and other languages that compile to EVM bytecode.

Generic [Solidity](#solidity) smart contracts can be deployed to any single chain in the network and will function as expected. However, to take full advantage of Quai's cross-chain functionality, developers must use [SolidityX](#solidityx) based smart contracts.

<Warning>
	The Quai Network EVM supports Solidity versions up to [0.8.19](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.19). Using a newer
	version of Solidity may result in errors when deploying smart contracts.
</Warning>

## Choosing Which Language To Use

There are a few main differences between Solidity and SolidityX that developers should consider when choosing which language to use for smart contract development on Quai Network.

<Tip>For most developers and use cases, generic Solidity is the recommend smart contract language choice.</Tip>

### Solidity

Generic Solidity is **recommended for most use cases and developers new to Quai Network**. It provides the most compatibility with existing Solidity and requires less initial configuration.

### SolidityX

SolidityX is **recommended for more advanced developers** looking to experiment with cross-chain functionality within Quai Network.
