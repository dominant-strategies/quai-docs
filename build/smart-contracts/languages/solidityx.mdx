description: The SolidityX smart contract programming language.

## Overview

SolidityX is a fork of Solidity that adds additional features and functionality to the language. SolidityX is a superset of Solidity, meaning that all Solidity code is valid SolidityX code. _It retains all of the features of Solidity_, while adding support for **Quai Network's cross-chain functionality** natively into the EVM.

The key additions to SolidityX include:

- Support for cross-chain transactions via the [etx](/build/smart-contracts/opcode-additions#etx) opcode.
- Support for cross-chain address validation via the [isaddrInternal](/build/smart-contracts/opcode-additions#isaddrinternal) opcode.

Additional opcode usage is currently supported via [inline assembly](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/assembly.html). More details on the usage of `etx` and `isaddrinternal` can be found on the [Opcode Additions page](/build/smart-contracts/opcode-additions).

## Example Implementation

Below is a simple implementation of the `isaddrinternal` opcode using inline assembly in a QRC20 contract. The function checks whether an address is on the same shard as the deployed contract and then decides whether to execute a local transfer or an external transfer.

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public payable  returns (bool) {
        bool isInternal;
        assembly {
            isInternal := isaddrinternal(to)  // This opcode returns true if an address is internal
        }
        require(isInternal, "Address is external. Use cross-chain transfer function.");
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
```
