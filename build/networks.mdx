## Quai Mainnet

The Quai Mainnet serves as the production environment for Quai Network. This network can be used by all to interact with tokens Quai and Qi. The Quai Mainnet is currently live and running the latest version of [go-quai](guides/client/node). Developers looking to test can use the Orchard Testnet.

#### RPC Endpoints

<Info>Cyprus-1 is the only active zone in Quai Network as of now.</Info>

| Zone Name | Zone Index | RPC Endpoint (https)             | RPC Endpoint (wss)             |

## Orchard Testnet

<Warning>
  This network is for development purposes only. Quai tokens on this network
  have no real value.
</Warning>

Orchard Testnet is a public isolated development environment that is designed to be used by both smart contract and tooling developers to test smart-contract deployments and infrastructure upgrades in a production-like environment.

QUAI on this testnet has no real value and thus testing deployments, interactions, and smart contracts are virtually free. As Orchard Testnet QUAI has no value, there are _no markets_ to purchase devnet tokens.

## Local Network

A local instance of Quai Network is an isolated development environment that can be spun up on a single machine. This private network offers faster block times, lower block difficulties with the full range of Quai Network capabilities.

Using a local network allows developers looking to launch applications to work faster and with better privacy than on a public testnet. They also provide the ability to easily control a network environment and develop privately.

You can easily spin up a pre-configured development environment using the [Local Node Runner](/guides/client/local-node) and [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). The Local Node Runner spins up a containerized local Quai environment complete with multiple shards, CPU miner, and accounts pre-loaded with Quai and Qi tokens.
