## Colosseum Testnet

The Colosseum Testnet serves as a place to experiment with new features and ensure they are stable for Mainnet release. When live, this network can be used by all to interact with the current stable version of the network. The Colosseum network is currently live and running the Golden Age Testnet version of go-quai. Developers looking to test can easily mint devnet QUAI from the [devnet faucet](https://faucet.quai.network).

QUAI on the testnet has no real value and thus testing deployments, interactions, and smart contracts are virtually free. As testnet QUAI has no value, there are _no markets_ to purchase testnet tokens.

The Quai Network testnet is named `colosseum` as it's where network upgrades go to "fight it out" prior to being pushed up to mainnet.

## Devnet

<Warning>
  The public developer network is not currently live.

</Warning>

Devnet is a public isolated development environment that is designed to be used by both smart contract and tooling developers to test smart-contract deployments and infrastructure upgrades in a production-like environment.

QUAI on the devnet has no real value and thus testing deployments, interactions, and smart contracts are virtually free. As devnet QUAI has no value, there are _no markets_ to purchase devnet tokens.

#### Explorer URLs and RPC Endpoints

<Warning>No public explorers or RPC endpoints are currently available for the devnet.</Warning>

## Local Network

A local instance of Quai Network is an isolated development environment that can be spun up on a single machine. This private network offers faster block times, lower block difficulties with the full range of Quai Network capabilities.

Using a local network allows developers looking to launch applications to work faster and with better privacy than on a public testnet. They also provide the ability to easily control a network environment and develop privately.

You can easily spin up a pre-configured development environment using the [Local Node Runner](/guides/client/local-node) and [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). The Local Node Runner spins up a containerized local Quai environment complete with multiple shards, CPU miner, and accounts pre-loaded with Quai and Qi tokens.
