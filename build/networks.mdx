## Devnet

<Tip>
  The public developer network is currently running the **Golden Age Testnet** version of the Quai Protocol, compatible with [quais v1.0.0-alpha.6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quais/v/1.0.0-alpha.6) and later.

This network is designed for developers to test features prior to the official release of the Golden Age Testnet and **has no incentives**.

</Tip>

Devnet is a public isolated development environment that is designed to be used by both smart contract and tooling developers to test smart-contract deployments and infrastructure upgrades in a production-like environment.

QUAI on the devnet has no real value and thus testing deployments, interactions, and smart contracts are virtually free. As devnet QUAI has no value, there are _no markets_ to purchase devnet tokens.

**The devnet is currently accesible by developers via the RPC endpoints below, but will remain closed to local node connections and miners**.

## Colosseum Testnet

<Warning>
  The public testnet is currently running the stable **Iron Age Testnet** version of the Quai Protocol, compatible with [quais v1.1.17](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quais/v/0.1.17) only.

If you are a developer starting to build an application, it is recommend that you build on the public devnet with the latest protocol and SDK versions in preparation for the **Golden Age Testnet**.

</Warning>

The Colosseum Testnet serves as a place to experiment with new features and ensure they are stable for Mainnet release. This network can be used by all to interact with the current stable version of the network. Colosseum is currently running the **Iron Age Testnet** version of the Quai Protocol, but will be upgraded to the Golden Age Testnet version when the Golden Age Testnet is publicly released in the near future.

QUAI on the testnet has no real value and thus testing deployments, interactions, and smart contracts are virtually free. As testnet QUAI has no value, there are _no markets_ to purchase testnet tokens.

Developers looking to test can easily mint testnet QUAI from the [testnet faucet](https://faucet.quai.network). Faucets generally are a simple web interfaces which you can input an address where you'd like tokens to be sent. Additionally, you can spin up a miner and mine blocks to acquire testnet QUAI tokens.

The Quai Network testnet is named `colosseum` as it's where network upgrades go to "fight it out" prior to being pushed up to mainnet. To point your node and miner to testnet, you'll have to edit your `network.env` file to:

```
NETWORK=colosseum
NONCE=5926993
```

## Local Network

A local instance of Quai Network is an isolated development environment that can be spun up on a single machine. This private network offers faster block times, lower block difficulties with the full range of Quai Network capabilities.

Using a local network allows developers looking to launch applications to work faster and with better privacy than on a public testnet. They also provide the ability to easily control a network environment and develop privately.

You can easily spin up a pre-configured development environment using the [Local Node Runner](/guides/client/local-node) and [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). The Local Node Runner spins up a containerized local Quai environment complete with multiple shards, CPU miner, and accounts pre-loaded with Quai and Qi tokens.
