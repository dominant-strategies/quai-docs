title: External Transaction (Type 1)
description: An explanation of External Transactions in Quai Network, including cross-shard and special purpose transactions.
---

## Structure

```go
type ExternalTx struct {
	OriginatingTxHash common.Hash
	ETXIndex          uint16
	Gas               uint64
	To                *common.Address // nil means contract creation
	Value             *big.Int
	Data              []byte
	AccessList        AccessList
	Sender            common.Address
	IsCoinbase        bool

	// External Transactions can be a tx generated by the EVM or a coinbase tx or a conversion tx
	// External transactions do not have signatures
	// for a coinbase tx the IsCoinbase returns true
}
```
## Subtypes

1. **True Cross-Shard Transaction**: Used for transferring value or data between different shards.
2. **Coinbase Transaction**: Special transaction for block rewards and fees.
3. **Conversion Transaction**: Used for converting between different types of assets or representations within the Quai Network.

The subtype can be determined by examining the `extType` value in the `extTransaction` array within a block.

## Key Features

- Does not include traditional signature fields (V, R, S)
- Contains `OriginatingTxHash` to link back to the original transaction
- Includes `ETXIndex` for ordering multiple external transactions from a single origin
- Has `IsCoinbase` flag for identifying coinbase transactions

## Usage

External Transactions are crucial for Quai Network's cross-shard communication and special operations like distributing block rewards.

## Note on Signing

Unlike Quai Transactions, External Transactions do not have a traditional signature. The `Sender` field is used to identify the origin of the transaction.
