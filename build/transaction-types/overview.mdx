# Transaction Types in Quai Network

Quai Network supports three main types of transactions:

1. **Quai Transaction (Type 0)**: Standard internal transactions within a shard.
2. **External Transaction (Type 1)**: Transactions that cross shard boundaries or serve special purposes.
3. **Qi Transaction (Type 2)**: A unique transaction type specific to Quai Network.

## External Transaction Subtypes

External transactions (Type 1) are further categorized into:

- True cross-shard transactions
- Coinbase transactions
- Conversion transactions

The subtype of an External Transaction can be determined by examining the `extType` value in the `extTransaction` array within a block.

Each transaction type has its own structure and purpose, which we'll explore in more detail in the following sections.
