title: Quai Transaction (Type 0)
description: Details on Quai Transactions, the standard internal transaction type in Quai Network.
---

## Structure

```go
type QuaiTx struct {
	ChainID    *big.Int
	Nonce      uint64
	GasTipCap  *big.Int
	GasFeeCap  *big.Int
	Gas        uint64
	To         *common.Address // nil means contract creation
	Value      *big.Int
	Data       []byte
	AccessList AccessList

	// Signature values
	V *big.Int
	R *big.Int
	S *big.Int

	// Work fields
	ParentHash *common.Hash
	MixHash    *common.Hash
	WorkNonce  *BlockNonce
}
```

## Key Features

- Uses ECDSA signatures (V, R, S values)
- Includes `ChainID` for replay protection
- Supports EIP-1559 style gas pricing with `GasTipCap` and `GasFeeCap`
- Includes `AccessList` for gas optimization and EVM parallelization
- Contains work-related fields: `ParentHash`, `MixHash`, and `WorkNonce`

## Usage

Quai Transactions are used for standard operations within a single shard, such as transferring Quai, interacting with smart contracts, or deploying new contracts.
