    The [QiHDWallet](/cn/sdk/content/classes/QiHDWallet) class provides additional low-level functionality on top of the base [Wallet](/cn/sdk/content/classes/Wallet) class, allowing for more granular control and wallet management.

    ## Initialize a Quai HD Wallet

    You can initialize a Quai HD wallet by creating a new instance from a mnemonic:

    ```js
    const quais = require('quais')

    // seed phrase
    const phrase = 'pill tomorrow foster begin walnut borrow virtual kick shift mutual shoe scatter'

    // initialize HD wallet from mnemonic
    const mnemonic = quais.Mnemonic.fromPhrase(phrase)
    const quaiWallet = quais.QuaiHDWallet.fromMnemonic(mnemonic)
    ```

    <Warning>
      It is highly recommended to **import secret phrases securely** from environment variables or files.
    </Warning>

    ## Derive Addresses

    Quai HD wallets allow for derivation of multiple accounts, addresses, and specific zones from a single mnemonic as specified by [BIP-32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032).

    ```js
    // derive new address for account '0' in 'Cyprus1' zone
    const addressInfo1 = await quaiWallet.getNextAddress(0, quais.Zone.Cyprus1)

    // derive new address for account '1' in 'Cyrpus2' zone
    const addressInfo2 = await quaiWallet.getNextAddress(1, quais.Zone.Cyprus2)
    ```

    The HD Wallet also provides a number of methods to return data for derived addresses by certain filters:

    ```js
    // get address info for account '0' new address '1'
    const addressInfo = quaiWallet.getAddressInfo(addressInfo1.address)

    // get all addresses for account '0' in 'Cyprus1' zone
    const cyprus1addressInfo = quaiWallet.getAddressesForZone(quais.Zone.Cyprus1)

    // get all addresses for account '0'
    const account0Addresses = quaiWallet.getAddressesForAccount(0)
    ```

    ## Storage and Transmission

    Wallet storage and transmission can be securely done using a serialized representation of the wallet. The HD wallet provides functionality for both serializing and deserializing the wallet.

    ```js
    // serialize current (account/address) state of the wallet
    const serializedWallet = quaiWallet.serialize()

    // deserialize wallet from serialized data
    const deserializedWallet = quais.QuaiHDWallet.deserialize(serializedWallet)
    ```

    The [QiHDWallet](/cn/sdk/content/classes/QiHDWallet) class manages Qi UTXO accounts and addresses.

    ## Initialize a Qi HD Wallet

    You can initialize a Qi HD wallet by creating a new instance from a mnemonic and syncing the UTXO set:

    ```js
    const quais = require('quais')

     // seed phrase
    const phrase = 'pill tomorrow foster begin walnut borrow virtual kick shift mutual shoe scatter'

    // initialize provider
    const provider = new quais.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.quai.network', undefined, { usePathing: true })

    // initialize HD wallet from mnemonic
    const mnemonic = quais.Mnemonic.fromPhrase(phrase)
    const qiWallet = quais.QiHDWallet.fromMnemonic(mnemonic)

    // connect to provider and sync UTXO set
    await qiWallet.connect(provider)
    await qiWallet.scan(quais.Zone.Cyprus1)
    ```

    To use a Qi HD wallet, you must first connect to a provider and sync the UTXO set. This will retrieve standard and change addresses, as well as scan the specified account for addresses with unspent outputs.

    <Warning>
      It is highly recommended to **import secret phrases securely** from environment variables or files.
    </Warning>

    Once scanning is complete, the addresses and outpoints can be retrieved using the following methods:

    ```js
    // get standard and change addresses
    let addresses = qiWallet.getAddressesForZone(quais.Zone.Cyprus1);
    let changeAddresses = qiWallet.getChangeAddressesForZone(quais.Zone.Cyprus1);

    const address1 = addresses[0].address

    // get outpoints for a specified zone
    let zoneOutpoints = qiWallet.getOutpoints(quais.Zone.Cyprus1);
    let addressOutpoints = qiWallet.getOutpointsByAddress(address1);
    ```

    ## Derive Addresses

    Qi HD wallets allow for derivation of multiple accounts, addresses, and specific zones from a single mnemonic as specified by [BIP-32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032).

    ```js
      // derive new address for account '0' and zone 'Cyprus1'
    let newAddrInfo = await qiWallet.getNextAddress(0,quais.Zone.Cyprus1);

    // derive new change address for account '1' and zone 'Cyprus2'
    let newChangeAddrInfo = await qiWallet.getNextChangeAddress(1, quais.Zone.Cyprus2);
    ```

    ## Storage and Transmission

    Wallet storage and transmission can be securely done using a serialized representation of the wallet. The HD wallet provides functionality for both serializing and deserializing the wallet.

    ```js
    // serialize current (account/address) state of the wallet
    const serializedWallet = qiWallet.serialize()

    // deserialize wallet from serialized data
    const deserializedWallet = quais.QiHDWallet.deserialize(serializedWallet)
    ```
