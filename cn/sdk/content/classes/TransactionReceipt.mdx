A **TransactionReceipt** includes additional information about a transaction that is only available after it has been
mined.

## Extended by

- [`ContractTransactionReceipt`](/cn/sdk/content/classes/ContractTransactionReceipt)

## Implements

- [`TransactionReceiptParams`](/cn/sdk/content/interfaces/TransactionReceiptParams)
- `Iterable`\<[`Log`](/cn/sdk/content/classes/Log)\>

## Properties

| Property | Modifier | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `#logs` | `private` | readonly [`Log`](/cn/sdk/content/classes/Log)[] | The root hash of this transaction.<br /><br />This is no present and was only included in pre-byzantium blocks, but could be used to validate certain parts of<br />the receipt. |
| `blockHash` | `readonly` | `string` | The block hash of the [**Block**](/cn/sdk/content/classes/Block) this transaction was included in. |
| `blockNumber` | `readonly` | `number` | The block number of the [**Block**](/cn/sdk/content/classes/Block) this transaction was included in. |
| `contractAddress` | `readonly` | `null` \| `string` | The address of the contract if the transaction was directly responsible for deploying one.<br /><br />This is non-null **only** if the `to` is empty and the `data` was successfully executed as initcode. |
| `cumulativeGasUsed` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The amount of gas used by all transactions within the block for this and all transactions with a lower `index`.<br /><br />This is generally not useful for developers but can be used to validate certain aspects of execution. |
| `from` | `readonly` | `string` | The sender of the transaction. |
| `gasPrice` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The actual gas price used during execution.<br /><br />Due to the complexity of [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) this value can only be caluclated<br />after the transaction has been mined, snce the base fee is protocol-enforced. |
| `gasUsed` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The actual amount of gas used by this transaction.<br /><br />When creating a transaction, the amount of gas that will be used can only be approximated, but the sender must<br />pay the gas fee for the entire gas limit. After the transaction, the difference is refunded. |
| `hash` | `readonly` | `string` | The transaction hash. |
| `index` | `readonly` | `number` | The index of this transaction within the block transactions. |
| `logsBloom` | `readonly` | `string` | The bloom filter bytes that represent all logs that occurred within this transaction. This is generally not<br />useful for most developers, but can be used to validate the included logs. |
| `provider` | `readonly` | [`Provider`](/cn/sdk/content/interfaces/Provider) | The provider connected to the log used to fetch additional details if necessary. |
| `status` | `readonly` | `null` \| `number` | The status of this transaction, indicating success (i.e. `1`) or a revert (i.e. `0`).<br /><br />This is available in post-byzantium blocks, but some backends may backfill this value. |
| `to` | `readonly` | `null` \| `string` | The address the transaction was sent to. |
| `type` | `readonly` | `number` | The [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transaction type. |
