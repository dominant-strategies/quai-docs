const wordlists: Record<string, Wordlist>;
```

The available Wordlists by their [ISO 639-1 Language Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) .

(**i.e.** LangCz | cz, [en](/cn/sdk/content/classes/LangEn), [es](/cn/sdk/content/classes/LangEs), LangFr | fr, LangJa | ja,
LangKo | ko, LangIt | it, LangPt | pt, LangZh | zh_cn, LangZh | zh_tw)

The dist files (in the `/dist` folder) have had all languages except English stripped out, which reduces the library
size by about 80kb. If required, they are available by importing the included `wordlists-extra.min.js` file.
