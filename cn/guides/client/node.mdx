<Warning>
  The coinbase values above are set to dummy values. If you do not replace them
  with your own addresses, you will not receive block rewards.
</Warning>
This will spin up a node using the values of the `node.slices`, `node.quai-coinbases`, `node.qi-coinbases` flags in your command. Logs should begin printing to the terminal.

### Stop

Stopping your node should be done any time you make changes to your config file or prior to shutting your machine down. A node instance can terminated using `CTRL+C`.

<Note>
  If you're running a miner, `CTRL+C` may not work. You must kill the miner
  process prior to stopping the node.
</Note>

### Environment Variables

There are a few key variables required to run a Quai node. **They will be passed as arguments in the [start command](#start)**.

- `quai-coinbases` and `qi-coinbases`: the addresses in each ledger that block rewards and miner tips are paid to.
- `miner-preference`: the percentage of block rewards that should be paid out on average in Quai or Qi tokens.
- `slices`: the slices of the network that the node will run.

<Note>
  There are a number of more advanced parameters that can be passed as arguments
  that _will not be covered_ in this article.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Mining Addresses">
    Coinbases will be passed to the `start` command similar to below, with your own addresses for the chains that you intend to mine. You can generate addresses for each shard and ledger easily with [Pelagus Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pelagus/nhccebmfjcbhghphpclcfdkkekheegop).

    You must generate **unique Quai and Qi addresses** for each shard your node is running and **pass them as coinbase flags to the run command**. There is a unique coinbases flag for each ledger:
    - `quai-coinbases`: Coinbases for Quai ledger
    - `qi-coinbases`: Coinbases for Qi ledger

    ```bash
    # single slice node running cyprus1, one quai address + one qi address
    --node.quai-coinbases '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
    --node.qi-coinbases '0x0080000000000000000000000000000000000000'
    ```

    <Note>
    The Qi mining address starts with a "0x00...", this is not to be confused with the Qi payment address. You can find the Qi mining address in the settings of the Pelagus Wallet.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Block Reward Prefernce">
    The Quai protocol can payout block rewards and miner tips in either [Quai](/cn/learn/tokenomics/quai-emissions) or [Qi](/cn/learn/tokenomics/qi-emissions) tokens. While miners have no ability to determine what token their miner tips are paid out in, the do have the ability to set their block reward payout token preference to either Quai or Qi.

    Block reward token preference can be set using the `miner-preference` flag. The `miner-preference` flag is a percentage scale that can be set to values between 0 and 1, indicating the proportion of block rewards that should be paid out in Quai or Qi tokens.

    Some examples:
    - `0`: 100% Quai preference, all block rewards are paid out in Quai
    - `0.25`: 3/1 Quai preference
    - `0.5`: Even split, on average block rewards are paid out equally in Quai and Qi
    - `0.75`: 3/1 Qi preference
    - `1`: 100% Qi preference, all block rewards are paid out in Qi

    Pass the `miner-preference` flag in the `start` command with a value between 0 and 1 like below:

    ```bash
    # no preference (default)
    --node.miner-preference 0.5
    ```

    ```bash
    # 100% Quai preference
    --node.miner-preference 0
    ```

    ```bash
    # 100% Qi preference
    --node.miner-preference 1
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Lockup Period">
    The Quai protocol immediately pays out block rewards as blocks are mined, but are subject to a lockup period. 
  
    - Quai Block rewards are sent to the coinbase of the miner after the lockup period has elapsed.
    - Qi Block reward tokens are sent to the coinbase of the miner and register as balance, but are deemed "not spendable" until they are unlocked.

    The lockup period is configurable by miners using the `--node.coinbase-lockup` flag. The protocol provides additional incentives for miners to lock up their block rewards for a longer period of time.

    The available values for `--node.coinbase-lockup` and their corresponding period and reward boost are:

    | Value | Period (blocks) | Period (days) | Reward Boost |
    | ----- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
    | `0*`  | 241,920         | 2 weeks       | **+0%**      |
    | `1`   | 1,555,200       | 3 months      | **+3.5%**    |
    | `2`   | 3,110,400       | 6 months      | **+10%**     |
    | `3`   | 6,220,800       | 12 months     | **+25%**     |

    <sub>\*Base maturity period</sub>

    Pass the `--node.coinbase-lockup` flag in the `start` command like below:

    ```bash
    # minimum lockup (default)
    --node.coinbase-lockup 0
    ```

    ```bash
    # maximum lockup
    --node.coinbase-lockup 3
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Slices">
    Set the `node.slices` flag in your run command to whichever slices of the network you would like to run.

    In the codebase, a slice is identified by its [region and zone index](/cn/client/node#networking-and-conventions). Region and zone indices are 0-indexed and range from 0-2.

    <Tip>The Colosseum Mainnet and Orchard Testnet only support the `[0 0]` slice.</Tip>

    ```bash
    # single slice node running cyprus1
    --node.slices '[0 0]'
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Network Environment & Genesis Nonce">
    To connect to Quai, you must have the correct genesis nonce for the intended network. The nonce acts as a password that allows your node to correctly compute the first canonical block in the chain.

    You'll pass the genesis nonce to your node on start-up using the `--node.genesis-nonce` flag.

    ```bash
    # Orchard Testnet geneis nonce
    --node.genesis-nonce 62242624366553750196964614682162313
    --node.environment "orchard"
    ```

    Options for `--node.environment` are: `"colosseum"` (mainnet), `"orchard"` (mainnet testnet), `"garden"` (mainnet devnet), and `"local"`.
    | Environment | Description | Genesis Nonce |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| `colosseum` | Mainnet | 23621466532946281564673705261963422 |
| `orchard` | Mainnet testnet | 62242624366553750196964614682162313 |
| `local` | Local development | N/A |
  </Step>

## Other Node Operations

<AccordionGroup >
  <Accordion title="Check log output" icon="binary-circle-check">
    Starting a node will run all instances of go-quai in the foreground and also create a directory named nodelogs to store more specific logs from the node. Outputs from the node will be piped to a context specific `.log` file inside of the nodelogs directory. To view the log output for a specific location, use:

    ```bash
    # view global logs (recommended)
    tail -f nodelogs/global.log

    # view specific region or zone logs
    tail -f nodelogs/region-0.log
    # OR
    tail -f nodelogs/zone-0-0.log
    ```

    Checking the node logs output is the best way to _verify that your full node is running correctly_. You can also easily view node logs in your favorite IDE or text editor.

    The outputs of a node that has **started correctly** should look similar to below.

    ```log

    ```

    **To stop log outputs to the terminal, you can use CTRL+C.**

    <Warning>Depending on what your node is currently doing, your logs may not look **exactly** the same as above.</Warning>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Checking sync progress" icon="rotate">
  If your node has started correctly, it will begin syncing chain state from peers. There are a few ways to check the progress of the sync.

    From the **command line**, we can run the following command(s) to print the list of blocks that have been appended. **Replace** `location-to-print-here.log` **with the file name of the logs you'd like to print**.

    ```bash
    # Print all appended blocks
    cat nodelogs/location-to-print-here.log | grep Appended

    # Continuously print new appended blocks
    tail -f nodelogs/location-to-print-here.log | grep Appended

    # Continuously print appended blocks across all chains
    tail -f nodelogs/* | grep Appended
    ```

    The output should look similar to below:

    ```bash

    ```

    **To check the progress of your node's sync, compare the number of the latest block output from the above command to the current height of the chain you're running on the** [**Quai node stats page**](https://stats.quai.network/).

    <Warning>
      If your node temporarily stops appending during sync, do not stop it. Allow it to continue running, and only reach out for support if the
      node has not appended a block for over 1 hour.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Update" icon="folder-check">
    <Warning>
      Initiating the node update process while the node or manager are currently running could cause issues. Make sure to stop all processes before updating.
    </Warning>

    To update a node, first **make sure to stop all instances of go-quai** before proceeding.

    After stopping the node, you should pull any updated code using:

    ```bash
    git fetch --all
    ```

    Checkout the [latest release of go-quai](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai/tags):

    ```bash
    git checkout put-latest-release-here
    ```

    Finally, rebuild the source using:

    ```bash
    make go-quai
    ```

    After pulling any new code and rebuilding the source, you can safely restart the node and continue running.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reset and clear" icon="power-off">
    <Warning>
      Resetting your node and clearing your database will remove any state you have synced. This is a non-reversible action and any commands noted below should be utilized with caution.
    </Warning>

    Developers and node runners may find that situations arise where they need to completely clear your node of synced state or do a full reset in the case of an issue or bug. A full reset of a node involves stopping the node, clearing the current nodelogs, and removing all synced state.

    **Reminder, resetting your node is non-reversible and should only be done if you understand the implications of removing all synced state.**

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Linux">
        For **Linux Machines**, we'll remove the `nodelogs` directory and the base `~/.local/share/go-quai` directory which contains all synced state. To do this, run the following command:

        ```bash
        rm -rf nodelogs ~/.local/share/go-quai
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="MacOS">
        For **MacOS machines**, we'll use a different command to remove the same directories:

        ```
      </Tab>
