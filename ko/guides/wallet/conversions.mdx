# How QUAI ↔ QI Conversions Work in the Pelagus Wallet (Market Make)

Starting **April 16, 2025**, you’ll be able to convert between **QUAI** and **QI** directly inside the [Pelagus](https://pelaguswallet.io) wallet through an advanced feature called **Market Make**.

Whether you're mining QI and want to swap to QUAI, or holding QUAI and want to convert into QI, this guide walks you through how Market Make works — including how **slippage**, **prime blocks**, and **token lockups** come into play.

---

## What is Market Make?

**Market Make** is Pelagus' advanced on-chain conversion feature that lets you exchange **QUAI ↔ QI**.

When you initiate a Market Make, you're submitting a special transaction to the Quai blockchain. It will execute during the **next prime block**—**if** your conditions are met.

---

## Step-by-Step: How Market Make Works

### 1. Start a Market Make Conversion

In the Pelagus wallet:

- Open the **Market Make** feature
- Choose your conversion direction (**QUAI → QI** or **QI → QUAI**)
- Enter the **amount**
- View the **current estimated slip**
- Set a **maximum slippage threshold** (e.g., `1.5%`)

---

### 2. Transaction Goes to Conversion Pool

Your Market Make transaction is submitted to the **Quai chain** and enters the **conversion pool**, where it waits for the **next prime block**.

---

### 3. Slippage May Change Before Finalization

> ⚠️  *Every conversion transaction will incur a 20 basis point slip*

During this waiting period:

- Other users may submit conversions
- **Total conversion pool volume increases**
- Result: **Slippage may increase dynamically**, especially during spikes in demand

---

### 4. What Happens at the Prime Block?

- **If final slippage ≤ your slippage threshold**:
  - Your conversion **succeeds**
  - You receive the **target asset (Qi or Quai)**
  - The output is **locked for 2 weeks**

- **If final slippage > your slippage threshold**:
  - Your conversion **fails**
  - But:
    - The transaction still executes on-chain
    - If converting **Qi → Quai**, your funds may be **aggregated**
    - After 2 weeks, you receive the **original asset** back

---

## What Is Slippage?

**Slippage** is the difference between the **expected** and **actual** conversion rate, driven by conversion volume changes in the conversion pool.

- Displayed at submission time
- **Not locked in** until the prime block
- Users set their **max slippage tolerance**
- **Higher conversion pool volume** = greater chance of slippage increasing

---

## 2-Week Lockup Applies to All Completed Transactions

Whether your transaction **succeeds or fails**:

- The output (QI or QUAI) is **locked for 2 weeks**
- This maintains system stability and prevents liquidity disruptions

| Concept             | Details                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Timing           | Conversions settle at the **next prime block**, not instantly           |
| Slippage             | You define your **maximum acceptable slippage** at submission              |
| Slippage Behavior    | Slip increases with **rising conversion pool volume**                          |
| Success Criteria | Final slippage must be **≤ your threshold**                                |
| Failed Converts  | Receive **original asset**, locked 2 weeks, may be **aggregated** (QI) |
| Lockup Period    | All output tokens are **locked for 2 weeks**                           |

## Example: Market Make in Action

You want to convert **5,000 QUAI into QI**.

- You submit the Market Make with a **1.5% slippage threshold**
- At submission, current slippage is **0.7%**
- Other users then submit **100,000 Quai** in conversions before the next prime block
- Final slippage = **2.1%**

### Result:
- Your transaction **fails**
- You receive your **original 5,000 QUAI back**

> **💡 Pro Tip**  
> To increase your chance of success:
> 
> - Choose a **reasonable slippage threshold** based on recent volume trends  
> - **Submit your transaction shortly after a prime block**, when the conversion pool volume has reset
