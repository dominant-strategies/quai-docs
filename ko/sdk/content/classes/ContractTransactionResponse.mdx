***

### getBlock()

```ts
getBlock(shard): Promise<null | Block>
```

Resolves to the Block that this transaction was included in.

This will return null if the transaction has not been included yet.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `shard` | [`Shard`](/ko/sdk/content/enumerations/Shard) | The shard to fetch the block from. |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| [`Block`](/ko/sdk/content/classes/Block)\>

A promise resolving to the block.

#### Inherited from

***

### getTransaction()

```ts
getTransaction(): Promise<null | QuaiTransactionResponse>
```

Resolves to this transaction being re-requested from the provider. This can be used if you have an unmined
transaction and wish to get an up-to-date populated instance.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| [`QuaiTransactionResponse`](/ko/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse)\>

A promise resolving to the transaction, or null if not found.

#### Inherited from

[`QuaiTransactionResponse`](/ko/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse).[`getTransaction`](/ko/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse#gettransaction)

***

### isMined()

```ts
isMined(): this is QuaiMinedTransactionResponse
```

Returns `true` if this transaction has been included.

This is effective only as of the time the TransactionResponse was instantiated. To get up-to-date information,
use [**getTransaction**](/ko/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse#gettransaction).

This provides a Type Guard that this transaction will have non-null property values for properties that are null
for unmined transactions.

#### Returns

`this is QuaiMinedTransactionResponse`

True if the transaction has been mined.

#### Inherited from

[`QuaiTransactionResponse`](/ko/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse).[`isMined`](/ko/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse#ismined)

#### Throws

If the transaction was replaced, repriced, or cancelled.

***

### removedEvent()

```ts
removedEvent(): OrphanFilter
```

Returns a filter which can be used to listen for orphan events that evict this transaction.

#### Returns

[`OrphanFilter`](/ko/sdk/content/type-aliases/OrphanFilter)

The orphan filter.

#### Inherited from

[`QuaiTransactionResponse`](/ko/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse).[`removedEvent`](/ko/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse#removedevent)

***

### reorderedEvent()

```ts
reorderedEvent(other?): OrphanFilter
```

Returns a filter which can be used to listen for orphan events that re-order this event against `other`.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `other`? | [`TransactionResponse`](/ko/sdk/content/type-aliases/TransactionResponse) | The other transaction to compare against. |

#### Returns

[`OrphanFilter`](/ko/sdk/content/type-aliases/OrphanFilter)

The orphan filter.

### replaceableTransaction()

```ts
replaceableTransaction(startBlock): QuaiTransactionResponse
```

Returns a new TransactionResponse instance which has the ability to detect (and throw an error) if the
transaction is replaced, which will begin scanning at `startBlock`.

This should generally not be used by developers and is intended primarily for internal use. Setting an incorrect
`startBlock` can have devastating performance consequences if used incorrectly.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `startBlock` | `number` | The block number to start scanning for replacements. |

#### Returns

[`QuaiTransactionResponse`](/ko/sdk/content/classes/QuaiTransactionResponse)

### toJSON()

```ts
toJSON(): any
```

Returns a JSON-compatible representation of this transaction.

#### Returns

`any`

***

### wait()

```ts
wait(confirms?): Promise<null | ContractTransactionReceipt>
```

Resolves once this transaction has been mined and has `confirms` blocks including it (default: `1`) with an
optional `timeout`.

This can resolve to `null` only if `confirms` is `0` and the transaction has not been mined, otherwise this will
wait until enough confirmations have completed.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `confirms`? | `number` | The number of confirmations to wait for. |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| [`ContractTransactionReceipt`](/ko/sdk/content/classes/ContractTransactionReceipt)\>

The transaction receipt, or `null` if `confirms` is `0`.
