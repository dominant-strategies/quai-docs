# What Are Transactions?

Transactions are cryptographically signed messages sent to and executed on Zone chains within Quai Network. Regardless of what ledger or chain you are on within the network, every state-changing operation requires a signed transaction.

Transactions are executed independently for each Zone chain and for each ledger (Quai or Qi).

## Transaction Types in Quai Network

Quai Network transactions are split into 3 different types, or categories depending on where they are executed.
