Bridging services and pricing oracles that allow the Quai Network users to bring their liquidity from their other homes into ours and also allow trading to occur cross-chain.

### 3. DeFi Protocols
Advanced borrowing and lending protocols that strengthen Quai Network's financial infrastructure. We're looking for innovative DeFi applications that leverage Quai's unique features and expand the network's capabilities.

### 4. Novel Applications
