## Introduction

Here, we'll be running an instance of [quai-gpu-miner](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-gpu-miner), the implementation of a Quai Network ProgPOW miner, on [Clore.AI](https://clore.ai/).

Clore.AI is a cloud compute marketplace that provides access to a distributed network of GPU computining nodes from anywhere in the world.

### Requirements

In order to run the quai-gpu-miner on Clore.AI and mine valid blocks, you'll need the following:

		icon='computer'
	/>
	<Card
		title='Configured Stratum proxy'

	/>
	<Card

	/>
</CardGroup>

## Environment Setup

### Clore Account

Start by [creating](https://clore.ai/register) or [logging into](https://clore.ai/login) your Clore account.

</Frame>

After logging into your account, head to the `Marketplace` tab. Here, you'll be able to see all of the available compute options available for rental.

</Frame>

Select a compute option and click on `Rental`. You'll be taken to a configuration page where you'll be able to configure your compute with quai-gpu-miner.

### Configure Clore Instance

On the configuration page, head to the `Select Image` section and fill in the `Custom Image` section with the following:

```bash
quainetwork/quai-gpu-miner-run
```

<Frame>
	<img src='/images/Clore/CloreSelectImage.png' />
</Frame>

Scroll down to the `Configure Order` section. We'll be filling in the environment variables for the `quai-gpu-miner-run` image. You'll need to add the following variables:

- `PLATFORM`
  - For NVIDIA cards, set this value to `U`.
  - For AMD cards, set this value to `G`.
- `STRATUM_IP` The IP address of your Stratum proxy.
- `STRATUM_PORT` The port of your Stratum proxy. The default stratum port is `3333`.

</Frame>

<Note>You will need to port forward the stratum port `3333` if you are not also running a stratum proxy on the same machine.</Note>

After filling out the environment variables section, you can click the `Create` button to create your Clore instance of quai-gpu-miner. This will start the mining process and charge your account for compute.

### Managing Your Instance

Once your miner is running, you can use the [My orders](https://clore.ai/marketplace) tab to manage your Clore instance.

You can verify that your instance is running by checking the miner logs through Clore or via your [stratum logs](/jp/guides/client/stratum#run).
